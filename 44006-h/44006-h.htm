on the<br />

Assassination of President Kennedy</h2>

<h2 id="t1"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_CHARLES_J_CARRICO" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_CHARLES_J_CARRICO">TESTIMONY OF DR. CHARLES J. CARRICO</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Charles J. Carrico was taken at 9:30 a.m., on March 25,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Charles J. Carrico is present in
response to a letter request for him to appear so that his deposition may be
taken in connection with the proceedings of the President's Commission on the
Investigation of the Assassination of President Kennedy in connection with
the inquiry into all phases of that assassination, including medical care rendered
at Parkland Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Dr. Carrico has been asked to testify relating to the treatment which he
rendered the President at Parkland Hospital. With that preliminary statement
of purpose, Dr. Carrico, would you please stand up and raise your right
hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before the President's Commission
in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Charles James Carrico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Physician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed by the State of Texas to practice medicine?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you outline briefly your educational background,
please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I attended grade school and high school in Denton, Tex.; received
a Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from North Texas State College in
1957, and an M.D. from Southwestern Medical School in 1961, and served an
internship at Parkland Memorial Hospital from 1961 to 1962, and a year of
Fellowship in Surgery at Southwestern, followed by my residency here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you working toward any specialty training, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I am engaged in a general surgery residency which will qualify
me for my boards in general surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what were your duties on November 22, 1963, at Parkland
Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At that time I was assigned to the elective surgery service and
was in the emergency room seeing some patients for evaluation for admission
to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what were you doing specifically around 12 o'clock noon?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Approximately 12 noon or shortly thereafter I was in the
clinic and was called to come into the emergency room to see these people and
evaluate them for admission and treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you notified that there was an emergency case on the way
to the hospital at approximately 12:30?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In which President Kennedy was involved?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. At that time I was in the emergency room seeing these patients
and the call was received that the President had been shot and was on his way
to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best recollection as to what time it was when you
received that call?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This was probably shortly after 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long after that call was received did the President's
party actually arrive at Parkland?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. An estimation would be 2 minutes or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Describe what occurred upon the arrival of the President's
party at Parkland, please.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. We were in the emergency room preparing equipment in response
to the call we had received when the nurse said over the intercom that
they were here. Governor Connally was rolled in first and was taken to one
of the trauma rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what identification was given to the trauma room to which
Governor Connally was taken?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Trauma room 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present at the time that Governor Connally came
into the emergency area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As I recall, Dr. Richard Dulany, myself, several of the nurses,
Miss Bowron is the only one I can definitely remember. Don Curtis, oral
surgery resident, and I believe Martin White, the intern, was there. These
are the only people I remember being present at that time. We had already
sent out a call for Dr. Baxter and Dr. Perry and the rest of the staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Dr. Dulany take any part in the treatment of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, no, sir; he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Dr. Martin White take any part in the treatment of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I believe he was in there and did the&mdash;he helped Dr. Curtis
with the cutdown, the initial cutdown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Dr. Dulany do?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Dr. Dulany and I initially went to see the Governor, as I said,
and he stayed with the Governor while I went to attend to the President, care
for the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was the first doctor to reach President Kennedy on his
arrival at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who else was with President Kennedy on his arrival, as
best you can recollect it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Mrs. Kennedy was there, and there were some men in the
room, who I assumed were Secret Service men; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify any nurses who were present, in addition to
Miss Bowron?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, I don't recall any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the President's condition upon his
arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. He was lying on a carriage, his respirations were slow, spasmodic,
described as agonal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by "agonal" if I may interrupt you for
just a moment there, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. These are respirations seen in one who has lost the normal
coordinated central control of respiration. These are spasmodic and usually
reflect a terminal patient.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you continue to describe your observations of the
President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. His&mdash;the President's color&mdash;I don't believe I said&mdash;he was an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
ashen, bluish, grey, cyanotic, he was making no spontaneous movements, I
mean, no voluntary movements at all. We opened his shirt and coat and tie
and observed a small wound in the anterior lower third of the neck, listened
very briefly, heard a few cardiac beats, felt the President's back, and detected
no large or sucking chest wounds, and then proceeded to the examination of
his head. The large skull and scalp wound had been previously observed
and was inspected a little more closely. There seemed to be a 4&ndash;5 cm. area
of avulsion of the scalp and the skull was fragmented and bleeding cerebral
and cerebellar tissue. The pupils were inspected and seemed to be bilaterally
dilated and fixed. No pulse was present, and at that time, because of the
inadequate respirations and the apparent airway injury, a cuffed endotracheal
tube was introduced, employing a larynzo scope. Through the larynzo scope
there seemed to be some hematoma around the larynx and immediately below
the larynx was seen the ragged tracheal injury. The endotracheal tube was
inserted past this injury, the cuff inflated, and the tube was connected to a
respirator to assist the inadequate respiration. At about this point the nurse
reported that no blood pressure was obtained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Carrico, with respect to this small wound in the anterior
third of the neck which you have just described, could you be any more
specific in defining the characteristics of that wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This was probably a 4&ndash;7 mm. wound, almost in the midline,
maybe a little to the right of the midline, and below the thyroid cartilage.
It was, as I recall, rather round and there were no jagged edges or stellate
lacerations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You said you felt the President's back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe in more detail just what the feeling of the
back involved at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Without taking the time to roll him over and look or to wash
off the blood and debris, and while his coat and shirt were still on his arms&mdash;I
just placed my hands at about his beltline or a little above and by slowly
moving my hands upward detected that there was no large violation of the
pleural cavity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you not take the time to turn him over?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. This man was in obvious extreme distress and any more thorough
inspection would have involved several minutes&mdash;well, several&mdash;considerable
time which at this juncture was not available. A thorough inspection
would have involved washing and cleansing the back, and this is not practical
in treating an acutely injured patient. You have to determine which things,
which are immediately life threatening and cope with them, before attempting
to evaluate the full extent of the injuries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever have occasion to look at the President's back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir. Before&mdash;well, in trying to treat an acutely injured
patient, you have to establish an airway, adequate ventilation and you have
to establish adequate circulation. Before this was accomplished the President's
cardiac activity had ceased and closed cardiac massage was instituted,
which made it impossible to inspect his back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was any effort made to inspect the President's back after he
had expired?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And why was no effort made at that time to inspect his back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I suppose nobody really had the heart to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You had begun to describe some of the action taken in order to
endeavor to revive the President. Will you continue with that description,
please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I believe we were to where the endotracheal tube had been inserted.
After this, the President&mdash;his respirations were assisted by the Bennett
machine. We again listened to his chest to attempt to evaluate the respirations.
Breath sounds were diminished, especially on the right, despite the fact that the
endotracheal tube was in place and the cuff inflated, there continued to be some
leakage around the tracheal wound. For this reason Dr. Perry elected to perform
a tracheotomy, and instructed some of the other physicians in the room to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
insert chest tubes, thoracotomy tubes. At the beginning of the resuscitation
attempt intravenous infusions had been started using polyethylene catheters by
venesection, lactated renger solution, and uncross-matched type O Rh negative
bloods were administered and 300 mg. of hydrocortisone were administered.
Shortly after the completion of the tracheotomy, Dr. Bashour arrived and had
connected the cardiac monitor. Although I never saw evidence of cardiac activity,
electrical cardiac activity, Dr. Clark stated that there was a perceptible
electrical beat which shortly thereafter disappeared, and closed cardiac massage
was instituted. The cardiac massage was successful in maintaining carotid and
radial pulses, but the patient's state rapidly deteriorated and at approximately
1 o'clock he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, in your opinion, was the cause of death?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. A head injury.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described all the treatment which was given to
the President as best you recollect it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As I recall; yes, sir; that's all&mdash;I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion or opportunity to examine the
President's clothing?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. We did not do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was no examination of clothing made, Dr. Carrico?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Again, this was a matter of time. The clothes were removed by
the nurses, as is the usual practice, and the full attention was devoted to trying
to resuscitate the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the examination of the President's back which you described
that you performed, did you note any bleeding from the back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. There was considerable blood on the cart and on his back. I
could not tell if this came from his back or had fallen down from the head injury.
There was also some cerebral tissue there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did your examination by feeling disclose with respect to
whether he had any back wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I did not feel any. Now, this certainly wouldn't detect a small
bullet entrance. All this examination is designed to do is to establish the fact
that there is no gross injury to the chest posteriorly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that a routine type of examination, to ascertain whether there
is a gross injury to the chest posteriorly?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the President's clothing with respect
to the presence of a back brace, if any?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. There was, on removing the President's shirt and coat, we noted
he was wearing a standard back support.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe that back support, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As I recall, it was white cotton or some fibrous support, with
staves, bones and if I remember buckled in the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How wide was it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. How wide?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I don't know; I didn't examine below&mdash;you see&mdash;as I recall, it
came about to his umbilicus&mdash;navel area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any Ace bandage applied to the President's hips that
you observed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No; I didn't remove his pants.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any opportunity to observe that area of his body
when his pants were removed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I had the opportunity, but I didn't look.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors were involved in the treatment of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Well, of course, Dr. Perry, Dr. Clark, Dr. Baxter, Dr. McClelland,
Dr. Peters was in the room, Dr. Bashour, Dr. Ronald Jones, Dr. Curtis, I believe,
Dr. White was there&mdash;initially, at least, I don't recall right offhand anyone else.
There were other doctors in there, I just can't specifically remember&mdash;there were
10 or 15 people in the room before it was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have an opinion, Dr. Carrico, as to the cause of the
punctate wound in the President's throat?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No; I really don't&mdash;just on the basis of what I know. We
didn't make an attempt, as you know, to ascertain the track of the bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I can't hear you.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As you know, we didn't try to ascertain the track of the bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And why did you not make an effort to determine the track of
the bullets?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Again, in trying to resuscitate the President, the time to do this
was not available. The examination conducted was one to try to establish
what life threatening situations were present and to correct these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any discussion among the doctors who attended
President Kennedy as to the cause of the neck wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; after that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what conversations were there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As I recall, Dr. Perry and I talked and tried after&mdash;later in the
afternoon to determine what exactly had happened, and we were not aware of
the missile wound to the back, and postulated that this was either a tangential
wound from a fragment, possibly another entrance wound. It could have been
an exit wound, but we knew of no other entrance wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the wound in the neck consistent with being either an
entry or exit wound, in your opinion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or, did it look to be more one than the other?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No; it could have been either, depending on the size of the
missile, the velocity of the missile, the tissues that it struck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Carrico, assume these facts, if you will&mdash;first, that President
Kennedy was struck by a 6.5-mm. missile which entered the upper-right posterior
thorax, just above the scapula, being 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion,
a-c-r-o-m-i-o-n (spelling) process, and 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid
process, and that the missile traveled between two strap muscles, proceeded
through the fascia channel without violating the pleural cavity, striking the side
of the trachea and exiting in the lower third of the anterior throat. Under
the circumstances which I have just described to you, would the wound which
you observed on the President's throat be consistent with the damage which
a 6.5-mm. missile, traveling at the rate of approximately 2,000 feet per second,
that being muzzle velocity, with the President being 160 to 250 feet away from
the rifle, would that wound be consistent with that type of a weapon at that
distance, with the missile taking the path I have just described to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I certainly think it could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what would your thinking be as to why it could produce
that result?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I think a missile of this size, traveling in such a direction that
it had very little deformity, struck nothing which would cause it to begin
tumbling, and was slowed very little by passing through this relatively easy
traversed planes, would not expend a great deal of energy on exit and would
very likely not tumble, thus producing a small, round, even wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What has been your experience, if any, with gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. In working in the emergency room at Parkland, we have seen a
fairly good number of gunshot wounds, and with .22 and .25 caliber weapons of
somewhat, possibly somewhat lower velocity but at closer range, we have seen
entrance and exit wounds of almost the same size, especially the same size, when
passing through superficial structures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what superficial structures did those missiles pass through
to which you have just referred?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. The ones I was referring to in particular were through the
muscles of the leg superficially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how many missile wounds, bullet wounds, have
you had an opportunity to observe in your practice, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I would guess 150 or 200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe as precisely for me as possible the nature
of the head wound which you observed on the President?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. The wound that I saw was a large gaping wound, located in
the right occipitoparietal area. I would estimate to be about 5 to 7 cm. in
size, more or less circular, with avulsions of the calvarium and scalp tissue.
As I stated before, I believe there was shredded macerated cerebral and cerebellar
tissues both in the wounds and on the fragments of the skull attached to
the dura.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any other opening in the head besides the one
you have just described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Specifically, did you notice a bullet wound below the large
gaping hole which you described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your opinion, Doctor, if you have one, as to how many
bullets were involved in the injuries inflicted on the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. As far as I could tell, I would guess that there were two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Prior to today, have you ever been interviewed by any representative
of the Federal Government?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir; the Secret Service talked to us shortly after the President's
death.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall who talked to you on that occasion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No; I don't recall his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the content of that interview?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. We spoke to him in Dr. Shires' office in the medical school concerning
the President's death, mostly my part was just a statement that the
written statement that I had submitted was true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now call your attention, Doctor, to a document heretofore
identified as Commission Exhibit No. 392, to a 2-page summary which purports
to bear your signature, and dated November 22, 1963, 1626 hours, and ask you
first of all if that is a photostatic copy of a report which you submitted?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, is that your signature at the end?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the facts set forth in there true and correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. They are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to this notation of a ragged wound of the trachea,
which is contained in your report, could you describe that in more specific
detail?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. In inserting the endotracheal tube, a larynzo scope was inserted
and it was noted that there was some discoloration at the lateral edge of the
larynx and there appeared to be some swelling and hematoma and in looking
through the chords which were partially open, a ragged tissue and some blood
was seen within the trachea itself. This was the extent of what I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that specific portion of the wound give any indication
as to direction of the bullet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No; it wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any characteristic within the neck area to give any
indication of the direction of the bullet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the Secret Service man whom you just described ask you
any questions beyond whether the contents of your report were true?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I can't recall any specific questions. He did ask some others
and they did concern the wounds, and what we felt the wounds were from,
the direction, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what response did you make to those inquiries?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Essentially the same as I have here. I said I don't remember
specifically.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to any other representative of the Federal
Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Not in connection with this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, have you talked to someone in connection with something
else?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Just some Government employment&mdash;Civil Service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But the only time you talked to anyone about your treatment
of President Kennedy and your observations relating to that treatment was on
this one occasion with the Secret service?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; except I just recalled since that time, another Secret Service
Agent&mdash;I did speak to him briefly. He asked me if I had any other information
and I said "no".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the total contents of that conversation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Prior to the time we went on the record here before you were
sworn in, did you and I have a brief conversation about the purpose of this
disposition, and the general nature of the questions which I would ask you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the information which you gave me at that time the
same as that to which you have testified here on the record?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever changed any of your opinions regarding your
treatment and observations of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Not as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By the way, Dr. Carrico, how old are you at the present time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Twenty-eight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was any bullet found in the President's body.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Not by us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any other notes or written record of any sort concerning
your treatment of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Not concerning the treatment. I have a note I wrote to my
children for them to read some day, but it doesn't concern the treatment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What does that concern?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. It just concerns the day and how I felt about it and why it
happened&mdash;maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Personal observations on your part?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you participate in any of the press conferences?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of assistance
in any way to the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. No, sir; I don't believe I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Carrico, have I made available to you a letter requesting
your appearance on Monday, March 30, before the Commission, and do you
acknowledge receipt of that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would it be possible for you to attend and testify at that
time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. I certainly can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. Carrico.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Carrico</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<h2 id="t7"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_MALCOLM_OLIVER_PERRY" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_MALCOLM_OLIVER_PERRY">TESTIMONY OF DR. MALCOLM OLIVER PERRY</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Malcolm Oliver Perry was taken at 3:25 p.m., on
March 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen
Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Malcolm O. Perry is present in
response to a letter request that he appear here to have his deposition taken in
connection with the proceedings of the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy, which is now inquiring into all facets of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
shooting, including the medical attention received by President Kennedy at
Parkland Hospital, in which Dr. Perry participated.</p>

<p>With that preliminary statement of purpose, would you please stand up,
Dr. Perry, and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the President's
Commission in these deposition proceedings will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Malcolm Oliver Perry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Physician and surgeon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how old are you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Thirty-four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed to practice medicine in the State of
Texas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Starting with high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That will be fine.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I attended high school at Allen High School and at Plano High
School, graduating from the latter in 1947. I entered the University of Texas
from whence I duly graduated with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1951. I
went to Southwestern Medical School of the University of Texas for the subsequent
4 years, graduating in 1955 with a degree of Doctor of Medicine. I
interned at Letterman's Army Hospital in San Francisco, and returned to a
residency in surgery at Parkland Hospital in July 1958. I finished that
residency in June 1962, and then returned to San Francisco and spent 1 year
as additional specialization in vascular surgery. I then returned in September
1963, to Southwestern Medical School of the University of Texas as an assistant
professor of surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your duties on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, as is accustomed, I was at that time on two services, both
a general surgery service and a vascular surgery service as a consultant and
attending surgeon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, what were you doing specifically shortly after noontime
on November 22?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, at the time of the incident in question, I was having lunch
in the main dining room with the chief resident, Dr. Ronald Jones, in preparation
for the usual Friday rounds at 1 o'clock with the residents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what occurred during the course of that luncheon?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Jones, as I say, and I were having lunch when an emergency
call came over the speaker system for Dr. Tom Shires, who is the chief of
surgery. I knew that Dr. Shires was in Galveston giving a paper and was
not in the hospital, so Dr. Jones picked up the page to see if he or I could be
of assistance. We were informed by the hospital operator that Mr. Kennedy
had been shot and was being brought to Parkland Hospital for care.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action did you take as a result of learning those
factors?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The dining room was located one floor up from the emergency
room, so Dr. Jones and I went immediately to the emergency room to render
what assistance we could.</p>

<p>At the time of our arrival in the emergency room, the President was already
there, and as I entered trauma room No. 1, Dr. James Carrico, the surgical
resident on duty, had just placed an endotracheal tube to assist respiration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present in addition to Dr. Carrico, if you recall, at
that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I cannot with accuracy relate all the people that were there&mdash;Dr.
Carrico, I saw and spoke to briefly. There were several other people in the
room. There were several nurses there&mdash;I don't know at this time who they
were. Mrs. Kennedy was in the room and there was a gentleman with her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
there were several other gentlemen both in the door and right outside the door
to the room. Some of them, I assume, part of the legal force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any other doctors in the room at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I did not. There was somebody else in the room, but
I don't know who it was. I remember only Dr. Carrico&mdash;I had the impression
that one of the interns was in the room, but this may be an impression gathered
after the fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the President's condition at the
time you first saw him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He was lying supine on the emergency cart directly in the
center of the room under the overhead lamp. His shirt had, been removed,
and intravenous infusion was being begun in the right leg, I believe. Dr.
Carrico was at the head of the table attaching the oxygen apparatus to assist
in respiration.</p>

<p>I noted there was a large wound of the right posterior parietal area in the
head exposing lacerated brain. There was blood and brain tissue on the cart.
The President's eyes were deviated and dilated and he was unresponsive.
There was a small wound in the lower anterior third in the midline of the
neck, from which blood was exuding very slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe that wound as precisely as you can, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The wound was roughly spherical to oval in shape, not a punched-out
wound, actually, nor was it particularly ragged. It was rather clean cut,
but the blood obscured any detail about the edges of the wound exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the condition of the edges of the wound, if you can
recollect?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I couldn't state with certainty, due to the fact that they were
covered by blood and I did not make a minute examination. I determined
only the fact that there was a wound there, roughly 5 mm. in size or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described it as precisely as you can; that wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else, if anything, did you observe as to the condition of
the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Spasmodic respiratory efforts were obvious, but I did not detect
a pulse nor a heart beat on a very rapid examination. It was apparent that
respirations were ineffective, even with the use of the endotracheal tube and
oxygen. At that point I asked Dr. Carrico if this was a wound in his neck
or had he begun the tracheotomy, and he said it was a wound and I, at that
point, asked someone to get me a tracheotomy tray, and put on some gloves
and initiated the procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you described everything that you can recollect
about your observations of the President before you started to work on him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There was no evidence to that cursory examination of any other
wound. I did not move the President. I did not turn him over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you not turn him over?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. At that point it was necessary to attend to the emergent procedure
and a satisfactory effective airway is uppermost in such a condition. If
you are unable to obtain an effective airway, then the other procedures are
to be of no avail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, on the subject of turning him over, did you ever turn
him over?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why didn't you turn him over after you had taken the initial
action on him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. After the tracheotomy tube was in place and we were breathing
for him, Dr. Clark and I had begun external cardiac massage, since we
had been unable to detect a heart beat, blood pressure, or pulse. I continued
with the cardiac massage while Dr. Clark examined the head wound, and he
and Dr. Jenkins conferred in regard to the electrocardiogram. It was determined
that none of the resuscitative measures were effective and the procedures
were then abandoned.</p>

<p>I had no further business in the room at that point, and I left the room
momentarily. I returned within a minute or so, because I had left my coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
where I dropped it and asked one of the nurses to hand me my coat, and I
left the room and went to the operating suite from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did that conclude your participation in the treatment of
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to the time you arrived in the
Emergency Room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I really don't know the time. It was about 12:30 or so when I
was eating and the call must have come thereabouts, and I didn't look at my
watch at that time, nor did I have an opportunity to look at it again until after
I had left the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to the time which elapsed from
the point that you knew it was 12:30, until the time you arrived at the emergency
room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It must have been within the next few minutes. I really don't
know. As I say, we were sitting there eating and I had no occasion to look at
my watch again. At that time I was much too busy to consult it further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to the time you left the emergency
room after finishing your treatment and work on the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. After I left trauma room No. 1, I went outside and washed my
hands and then I retrieved my coat and I sat down for a few minutes in a
chair there in the emergency room for probably 10 or 15 minutes, I suppose,
and then I went from there to the operating suite to assist in the care of the
Governor, so I must have left the emergency room probably somewhere around
1:15 or 1:20, I would gather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time was the President pronounced to
be dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I don't know this for a fact, other than what was related to me
by Dr. Clark, and he tells me that this was at 1 o'clock. Once again, I did not
verify the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you described all of the efforts which were made to revive
the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There were other procedures done that I did not do during this
period. I did not describe in detail the performance of the tracheotomy. It
seems that that is really not necessary at this time, unless you want it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe it in detail, the procedures which were followed
in the efforts to save the President's life?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. All right. Well, to regress, then, at the time I began the tracheotomy,
I made an incision right through the wound which was present in the
neck in order to gain complete control of any injury in the underlying trachea.</p>

<p>I made a transverse incision right through this wound and carried it down to
the superficial fascia, to expose the strap muscles overlying the thyroid and the
trachea. There was an injury to the right lateral aspect of the trachea at the
level of the external wound. The trachea was deviated slightly to the left and it
was necessary to divide the strap muscles on the left side in order to gain access
to the trachea. At this point, I recall, Dr. Jones right on my left was placing a
catheter into a vein in the left arm because he handed me a necessary instrument
which I needed in the performance of the procedure.</p>

<p>The wound in the trachea was then enlarged to admit a cuffed tracheotomy
tube to support respiration. I noted that there was free air and blood in the
superior right mediastinum.</p>

<p>Although I saw no injury to the lung or to the pleural space, the presence of
this free blood and air in this area could be indicative of a wound of the right
hemithorax, and I asked that someone put a right chest tube in for seal drainage.
At the time I did not know who did this, but I have been informed that
Dr. Baxter and Dr. Paul Peters inserted the chest tube and connected it to
underwater drainage.</p>

<p>Blood transfusions and fluid transfusions were being given at this time, and
through the previous venesections that had been done by Dr. Jones and Dr.
Carrico.</p>

<p>Also, the President had received 300 mg. of Solucortef in order to support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
his adrenal glands, since it was common medical knowledge that he suffered
from adrenal insufficiency.</p>

<p>Of course, oxygen and pressure breathing were being effected under the
guidance of Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Giesecke, who were handling the anesthesia
machine at the head of the table.</p>

<p>Dr. Bashour and Dr. Seldin, in addition to Dr. Clark, had arrived and also
assisted in monitoring cardiac actions, as indicated by the oscilloscope and the
cardiotachioscope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described all of the operative procedures performed
on the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, all that I am familiar with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any doctors who participated other than those whom
you have already identified in the course of your description?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, sir; immediately on arriving there, and as I say, Dr. Jones
and I, and I saw Dr. Carrico, and I have the impression there was another
physician there, but I don't know who it was. I asked that an emergency call
be placed for Dr. Kemp Clark, chief of neurosurgery, for Dr. Robert McClelland,
and Dr. Charles Baxter, assistant professors of surgery. They responded
immediately. I don't know how long it took them to get there, but they were
probably there within the next few minutes. My first recollection of Dr.
McClelland and Dr. Baxter being there was when I was doing the tracheotomy,
they suddenly were there assisting me. I don't know when they came in the
room, nor do I know when Dr. Clark or the other gentlemen arrived, and
there must have been 10 or 12 doctors all told by then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are there any others whom you could identify?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Peters&mdash;I previously mentioned, Dr. Paul Peters, assistant
professor of urology, Dr. Fouad Bashour, associate professor of medicine, and
chief of cardiology, and Dr. Don Seldin, chief of medicine.</p>

<p>I mentioned Dr. M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins, chief of anesthesia, and Dr. Giesecke, his
assistant professor of anesthesiology&mdash;that's the only people that I saw directly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could the first doctor whom you saw have been Dr. Don Curtis?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That's entirely possible&mdash;I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Dr. Dulany there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I have initially had the impression that Dr. Dulany was in the
room when I came in there, but as I understand it, he actually was just going
into the room across the hall, but he was there by the door when I came
in, but I had the impression he was leaving that room, but I understand he
was not, that actually he was going&mdash;just going in the room across the hall
with the Governor, although I initially thought Dr. Dulany was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe, if anything with respect to bruising
in the interior portion of the President's neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There was considerable hematoma in the right lateral portion
of the neck and the right superior mediastinum, as I noted. As for bruising,
per se, it would be difficult to describe that, since by definition, hematoma would
be a collection of blood, and there was so much blood that the tissues were
discolored. I did not attempt to ascertain trajectory or path of the bullet at
the time, but directed myself to obtaining an adequate airway and carried my
examination no further down than it was necessary to assure myself that the
trachea was controlled and that there was no large vessel injury at that
level.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there sufficient facts available to you for you to reach a
conclusion as to the cause of the wound on the front side of the President's
neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir, there was not. I could not determine whether or how
this was inflicted, per se, since it would require tracing the trajectory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the President's head, specifically?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I saw no injuries other than the one which I noted to you, which was
a large avulsive injury of the right occipitoparietal area, but I did not do a
minute examination of his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice a bullet hole below the large avulsed area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, earlier I asked you whether you turned over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
President at any time during the course of your treatment or examination
of him, and you indicated that you had not, and I then asked you why, and
you proceeded to tell me of the things that you did in sequence, as being
priority items to try to save his life. Why did you not turn him over at the
conclusion of those operative procedures?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, actually, I didn't have a specific reason, other than it had been
determined that he had expired. There was nothing further that I could do
and it was not my particular prerogative to make a minute examination to
determine any other cause. I felt that that was a little bit out of my domain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any occasion to examine the President's clothing
to ascertain direction of the missile?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No; I did not. The only aspect of clothing that I know about&mdash;I
happen to recall pushing up the brace which he had on in an attempt to feel a
femoral pulse when I arrived, and I could not, but the shirt had been removed by
the personnel there in the emergency room, I assume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the description of that brace?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I couldn't give you a description. I just saw and felt the lower
edge of one, and I reached to feel the left femoral pulse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see whether the President was wearing any sort of an
Ace bandage on the midsection of his body when his trousers were taken
down?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There was evidence of an Ace bandage&mdash;I saw it sticking out from
the edge on the right side, as I recall. I don't believe it was on the midsection,
although it may have been. I believe it was on his right leg&mdash;his right thigh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether it was on the left leg and thigh as well?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, I don't. I just saw that briefly when I was reaching for that
pulse and I didn't do any examination at all of the lower trunk or lower
extremities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you personally make any examination by feeling, or in
any other way, of the President's back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you participate in a press conference or press conferences
following the death of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when was the first of such press conferences?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I don't know the exact time, Mr. Specter. It must have been
within the hour, I would say; I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was present at that press conference by way of
identifying, if you can, the members of the news media?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I have no idea. The press conference was held in classrooms 1
and 2 combined here at Parkland. The room was quite full of people. I remember
noting some surprise how quickly they had put in a couple of telephones
at the back. There were numerous cameras and lights, and flashbulbs,
and I went there with one of the administrators, Mr. Landregan, and Dr. Kemp
Clark and Mr. Hawkes, who was identified to me as being with the White House
Press. I don't know&mdash;there were numerous people of the press.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors appeared and spoke at that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Clark, myself, and Dr. Baxter was also there. He arrived
a little bit late. I called him just before I went down and asked him and
Dr. McClelland to come. I could not find Dr. McClelland. He apparently was
busy with a patient at the time. I recall Dr. Baxter came in after the press
conference had begun, but I don't believe he said anything. Dr. Clark and I
answered the majority of the questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, what questions were asked of you and what responses
did you give at that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, there were numerous questions asked, all the questions I
cannot remember, of course. Specifically, the thing that seemed to be of most
interest at that point was actually trying to get me to speculate as to direction
of the bullets, the number of bullets, and the exact cause of death.</p>

<p>The first two questions I could not answer, and my reply to them was that
I did not know, if there were one or two bullets, and I could not categorically
state about the nature of the neck wound, whether it was an entrance or an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
exit wound, not having examined the President further&mdash;I could not comment
on any other injuries.</p>

<p>As regards the cause of death, Dr. Clark and I concurred that massive brain
trauma with attendant severe hemorrhage was the underlying cause of death,
and then there were questions asked in regard to what we did, and I described
as I have for you, although not in such detail&mdash;essentially the resuscitative
measures that were taken at that time; namely, the reinfusion of a balanced
salt solution of blood, Solucortef, assisting of respiration with oxygen and
pressure apparatus, the tracheotomy, and the chest tubes and the monitoring
with the cardiotachioscope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you express a view as to what might have happened with
respect to the number of bullets?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I was asked by several of the people of the press, initially, if
there were one or two or more bullets, and to that, Dr. Clark and I both
replied that we could not say. I was then asked if it was conceivable that
it could have been caused by one bullet, and I replied in the affirmative, that
I did not know, but it was conceivable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you elaborate on how it could have been caused by one
bullet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I was asked if this were one bullet, how would it occur, and I
said, "It is conceivable or possible that a bullet could enter and strike the
spinal column and be deviated superiorly to exit from the head."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where would that point of entry have been?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The surmise was made that if the point of entry were in the
neck, how would it have happened, and that is the way I would have reconstructed
it. Again, this was speculation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you denominate it clearly as speculation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or, what could have been as opposed to what your opinion was?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did. I said this was conceivable&mdash;this was possible, but again,
Dr. Clark and I emphasized again that we did not know whether there was
one or two bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you express any view as to whether it might have been
one bullet or two bullets or either, or what?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I said I did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you asked any other questions at that press conference
that you can recollect as being important at this time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Someone did ask us about Mrs. Kennedy, and I recall that I mentioned
that I did not speak to her, but that she was very composed and very
quiet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were you a part of any other press conferences?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did the next one occur?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There were several organized press conferences that occurred in
the administration suite in the hospital, Mr. Specter, and I don't know the
exact times of these. There were several later that afternoon. There were
some the following day, on Saturday, also held in the administrator's office,
and then there were subsequent conferences in relation to the other incident
that occurred on Sunday with Mr. Oswald. I don't know how many there
were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were all these conferences set up by the administration of the
hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. They were all conducted here. They weren't necessarily&mdash;I
wouldn't say&mdash;set up by the administration. They were done here at the
hospital, with one exception, of which you are aware, that I spoke with you about
the gentleman that came to me when I was out of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you elaborate upon what occurred on that occasion, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I had taken the course of complying with the press insofar as
was possible about what I could speak that was common knowledge and which
had already been covered at the initial press conference. I had done that
in the administrative suite or in the hospital or in the medical school under an
organized situation as opposed to doing it, say, at home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
I left town Monday following the incident on Sunday with Oswald, in order
to secure a little bit of rest for myself and my family, and approximately
36 hours later, members of the press had located me and requested an interview,
which I granted, denying any photographs and the interview consisted
of essentially the same thing that I had given to the previous press conference
at the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was that interview conducted?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That was in McAllen, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the course of all of these press conferences did you say
anything other than that which you have already related you said during
the course of the first press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That would require a little bit of thought. I don't think in essence
I said anything different. Of course, the wording certainly would have been
different. I subsequently had a little bit more knowledge about the initial
episode attendant of course upon my discussions with the other doctors and
the writing out of our statements, knowledge which I did not have initially,
which may have made subsequent statements perhaps more accurate as regards
to time and people, but in essence, things that I did and things that I said
that I did are essentially the same in all of these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, I now show you a group of papers heretofore identified
as Commission Exhibit No. 392, and I turn to two sheets which are dated
November 22, 1963, which have the name "Perry" beside the doctor and purport
to bear your signature, and the time&mdash;1630 hours, 22 November 1963, and I
ask you if this is a photostatic copy of the handwritten report which you submitted
concerning the attention you gave to the President on the day of the
assassination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is this your signature appearing on the second sheet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is my signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the facts set forth herein true and correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. They are, to the best of my knowledge, correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, have contents of the autopsy report conducted at
Bethesda Naval Hospital been made available to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. They have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the findings in the autopsy report consistent with your
observations and conclusions concerning the source and nature of the President's
wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes; they are. I think there are no discrepancies at all. I did
not have that information initially, and as a result was somewhat confused
about the nature of the wounds, as I noted&mdash;I could not tell whether there was
one or two bullets, or from whence they came, but the findings of the autopsy
report are quite compatible with those findings which I noted at the time that
I saw the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you noted in the autopsy report the reference to
the presence of a wound on the upper right posterior thorax just above the
upper border of the scapula, being 7 by 4 mm. in oval dimension and being
located 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion process and 14 cm. below the
tip of the right mastoid process?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes; I saw that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Assuming that was a point of entry of a missile, which parenthetically
was the opinion of the three autopsy surgeons, and assuming still
further that the missile which struck the President at that spot was a 6.5-mm.
jacketed bullet shot from a rifle at a distance of 166 to 250 feet, having a muzzle
velocity of approximately 2,000 feet per second, and that upon entering the
President's body, the bullet traveled between two strap muscles, through a
fascia channel, without violating the pleural cavity, striking the trachea,
causing the damage which you testified about being on the interior of the
President's throat, and exited from the President's throat in the wound which
you have described in the midline of his neck, would your findings and observations
as to the nature of the wound on the throat be consistent with the set
of facts I just presented to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It would be entirely compatible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the basis for your conclusion that the situation
that I presented to you would be entirely compatible with your observations and
findings?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The wound in the throat, although as I noted, I did not examine
it minutely, was fairly small in nature, and an undeformed, unexpanded missile
exiting at rather high speed would leave very little injury behind, since the
majority of its energy was expended after it had left the tissues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would the hole that you observed on the President's throat
then be consistent with such an exit wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. It would. There is no way to determine from my examination as
to exactly how accurately I could depict an entrance wound from an exit wound,
without ascertaining the entire trajectory. Such a wound could be produced
by such a missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any facts on trajectory available to you at the time of
the press conferences that you described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. They were not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In response to an earlier question which I asked you, I believe
you testified that you did not have sufficient facts available initially to form an
opinion as to the source or direction of the cause of the wound, did you not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That's correct, although several leading questions were directed
toward me at the various conferences.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And to those leading questions you have said here today that you
responded that a number of possibilities were present as to what might have
happened?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That's correct. I had no way of ascertaining, as I said, the true
trajectory. Often questions were directed as to&mdash;in such a manner as this:
"Doctor, is it possible that if he were in such and such a position and the bullet
entered here, could it have done that?" And my reply, "Of course, if it were
possible, yes, that is possible, but similarly, it did not have to be so, necessarily."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that, from the physical characteristics which you observed
in and of themselves, you could not come to any conclusive opinion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I could not, although I have been quoted, I think, as
saying, and I might add parenthetically, out of context, without the preceding
question which had been directed, as saying that such was the case, when
actually, I only admitted that the possibility existed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And in the hypothetical of the rather extended nature that I
just gave you that your statement that that is consistent with what you found,
is that also predicated upon the veracity of the factors, which I have asked you
to assume?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That is correct, sir. I have no way to authenticate either by my
own knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Has your recollection of the nature of the President's neck
wound changed at any time from November 22 to the present time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir. I recall describing it initially as being between 3 and 5
cm. in size and roughly spherical in shape, not unlike a rather large puncture
wound, I believe is the word I used initially.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever changed your opinion on the possible alternatives
as to what could have caused the President's wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; I have no knowledge even now of my own as to the
cause of the wounds. All I can report on is what I saw, and the wound is
that as I have described it. It could have been caused conceivably by any
number of objects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, that the wound that you saw on the President's neck would
be consistent with an exit wound under the factors that I described to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or, it might be consistent with an entry wound under a different
set of factors?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. That's correct, sir. I, myself, have no knowledge of that. I do
not think that it is consistent, for example, with an exit wound of a large
expanded bullet&mdash;voluntarily I would add that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, would a jacketed 6.5-mm. bullet fit the description of a
large expanded bullet?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; it would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on the information in the autopsy report about a 6- by
15-mm. hole in the lower part of the President's skull on the right side in conjunction
with the large part of the skull of the President which you observed to
be missing, would you have an opinion as to the source of the missile which
inflicted those wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Since I did not see the initial wound which you mentioned, the
smaller one, and only saw the large avulsive wound of the head and the scalp,
there is no way for me to determine from whence it came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, if you assume the presence of the first small wound, taking
as a fact that there was such a wound, now, would that present sufficient
information for you to formulate an opinion as to source or trajectory?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, I couldn't testify as to exact source, but if the wound, the
smaller wound that you noted were present, it could certainly result in the
large avulsive wound as it exited from the skull. As to the ultimate source,
there would still be no way for me to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, could you tell sufficient to comment on whether it came
from the front or back of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. In the absence of other wounds of the head, the presence of the
small wound which you described, in addition to the large avulsive wound of
the skull and the scalp which I observed would certainly indicate that the two
were related and would indicate both an entrance and an exit wound, if there
were no other wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And which would be the wound of entrance, then?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The smaller wound&mdash;the smaller wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you have occasion to talk via the telephone with Dr.
James J. Humes of the Bethesda Naval Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And will you relate the circumstances of the calls indicating
first the time when they occurred.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Dr. Humes called me twice on Friday afternoon, separated by
about 30-minute intervals, as I recall. The first one, I, somehow think I
recall the first one must have been around 1500 hours, but I'm not real sure
about that; I'm not positive of that at all, actually.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could it have been Saturday morning?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Saturday morning&mdash;was it? It's possible. I remember talking
with him twice. I was thinking it was shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, the record will show.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Oh, sure, it was Saturday morning&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What made you change your view of that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. You mean Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did some specific recollection occur to you which changed your
view from Friday to Saturday?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, I was trying to place where I was at that time&mdash;Friday
afternoon, and at that particular time, when I paused to think about it, I
was actually up in the operating suite at that time, when I thought that he
called initially. I seem to remember it being Friday, for some reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you when you received those calls?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I was in the Administrator's office here when he called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did he ask you, if anything?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. He inquired about, initially, about the reasons for my doing a
tracheotomy, and I replied, as I have to you, during this procedure, that
there was a wound in the lower anterior third of the neck, which was exuding
blood and was indicative of a possible tracheal injury underlying, and I did
the tracheotomy through a transverse incision made through that wound, and
I described to him the right lateral injury to the trachea and the completion
of the operation.</p>

<p>He subsequently called back&mdash;at that time he told me, of course, that he could
not talk to me about any of it and asked that I keep it in confidence, which I did,
and he subsequently called back and inquired about the chest tubes, and why
they were placed and I replied in part as I have here. It was somewhat more
detailed. After having talked to Drs. Baxter and Peters and I identified them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
as having placed it in the second interspace, anteriorly, in the midclavicular
line, in the right hemithorax, he asked me at that time if we had made any
wounds in the back. I told him that I had not examined the back nor had I
knowledge of any wounds of the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you relate the circumstances surrounding an article
which appeared about you in the Saturday Evening Post, Dr. Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. The Saturday Evening Post contacted the department of surgery
here, and talked with Dr. Tom Shires, chief of surgical services, in regard to a
possible article on the treatment of the President. This was declined by us,
and we requested that no such article be printed, and Dr. Shires informed me
shortly thereafter about this conversation. Subsequently, an article was
printed, which apparently was a copyrighted item. It first appeared in the
New York Herald Tribune. It contained my picture and a picture of trauma
room No. 1, and described the incidents surrounding the treatment of the President.
Some of that information was obtained by personal interview of myself
and Dr. Shires on Saturday morning, and I assume that the rest of it was obtained
from various people here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the content of that story accurate?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. There were certain inaccuracies&mdash;the overall content was fairly
consistent&mdash;there were inaccuracies in identification of participants and there
were some inaccuracies in regards to conversations purported to have been
held, and I do not, however, have knowledge about some of the other references
made in the article, since they were apparently based on interviews with people
other than myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, have you talked to any representatives of the Federal
Government about this matter prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you relate whom you have talked to and on what
occasions? As best you can recollect it.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Well, I talked to several people, and I regret that I did not keep
a record of it, and I find at this time that a lot of these things such as Dr.
Humes' call, I suppose I should have kept a little better record, since everything
was so kaleidoscopic that I have a very difficult time putting the proper sequence
on it. I talked to several people who identified themselves both by name and
with credentials as being affiliated with the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On how many occasions have you talked with Secret Service
personnel?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. At least three times, sir. Now, I can't give you the exact dates
of these, and unfortunately the last two gentlemen, I can't even remember their
names now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the first gentleman?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, his either. I was trying to think of the last two. I indicated
that they both had the same last name, but at the present time it escapes me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you tell them in essence?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Essentially what I have told you in regard to my impressions and
my care of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Has there ever been any variation in the information which
you have given the Federal investigators?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir; not in essence. There may have been a variation in
wording or sequence of my presentation, but the treatment as I outlined it to
you and as I outlined it to them, to the best of my knowledge, has been essentially
consistent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to any other representatives of the Federal
Government besides the Secret Service men?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I talked to two gentlemen initially within&mdash;who identified themselves
as being with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. I do not recall their
names either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did they ask you about?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Essentially the same questions in regard to what I might speculate
as to the origin of the missiles and their trajectory, and I replied to them as I
have to you that I could not ascertain this of my own knowledge, and described
the wounds to the extent I saw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you set forth here today the same information which you
gave to the FBI?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes, I think this is considerably in more detail, being essentially
the same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now told me about all of the talks you have had with
representatives of the Federal Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I think I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you and I sit down and talk about the purpose of this
deposition and the questions which I would be asking you on the record, before
this deposition started?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you give me the same information which you provided
on the record here today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be helpful
in any way to the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Perry, we appreciate your coming for your deposition today,
and I have given you a letter requesting your presence in Washington on Monday
morning at 9 o'clock and I would ask you, for the record, to acknowledge
receipt of letter, if you will, please.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Yes; I have the letter here and I will be there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you, very much, sir. Let me ask you one more question,
Dr. Perry, for the record, before we terminate this deposition. What experience
have you had, if any, with gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. I think in the course of my training here at Parkland, which is
a city-county hospital and handles the great majority of the trauma cases that
occur in Dallas County, that I have seen a fairly considerable number of
traumatic wounds caused by knives, automobile accidents, gunshot wounds
of various types.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had any experience with gunshot wounds, in addition
to that obtained here at Parkland?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. You mean, in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, I had occasion to see only one gunshot wound while I was
in the service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you estimate how many gunshot wounds you have seen
while you have been at Parkland?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Probably it would be numbered in the hundreds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had any formal training in ballistics?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. No, other than the fact that I do some hunting and amateur hand
loader.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Amateur what?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. Amateur hand loader&mdash;hand load ammunition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Perry</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t18"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_WILLIAM_KEMP_CLARK" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_WILLIAM_KEMP_CLARK">TESTIMONY OF DR. WILLIAM KEMP CLARK</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. William Kemp Clark was taken at 11:50 a.m., on
March 21, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you stand up please, Dr. Clark, and raise your right
hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the President's
Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy in this deposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You may be seated.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The President's Commission is investigating all facts related
to the Assassination of President Kennedy, and you have been asked to testify
in this deposition proceeding relating to the medical treatment received by
President Kennedy at Parkland Memorial Hospital and all facts incident thereto.</p>

<p>Dr. Clark, have you received a letter from the President's Commission enclosing
a copy of the Executive Order establishing the Commission and a copy of
a Senate and House Joint Resolution about the Commission, and a letter relating
to the taking of testimony by the Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you willing to proceed with this deposition today, even
though 3 days have not elapsed between the time you received the letter and
this morning?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. William Kemp Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline in a general way your educational background,
please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes. I graduated from the University of Texas in Austin, 1944.
I graduated from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston in 1948.
I interned at Indiana University Medical Center and was a resident in surgery
there from 1948 to 1950. I spent 2 years in the Air Force and then took my
residency in neurological surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New
York City. This was from 1953 to 1956, at which time I came to the University
of Texas, Southwestern Medical School, as chairman of the division of neurological
surgery.</p>

<p>Would you like the professional qualifications?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; may I have the professional qualifications in summary
form, if you will, please.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I am board certified by the American Board of Neurological
Surgery. I am a Fellow with the American College of Surgeons. I am a
member of the Harvey Cushing Society.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the Harvey Cushing Society, by the way?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. It is the largest society of neurological surgeons in the world.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what do your duties consist of with respect to the Southwestern
Medical School of the University of Texas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I am in charge of the division of neurological surgery and carry
the responsibility of administering this department or this division, to arrange
the instruction of medical students in neurological surgery and to conduct
research in this field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your duties back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Essentially these. I also, as chairman of the division, have
the responsibility as director of neurological surgery at Parkland Memorial
Hospital which is the major teaching hospital of the medical school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you receive notification on November 22, 1963, that the
President had been wounded and was en route to this hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know at approximately what time you got that notification?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Approximately 12:20 or 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action, if any, did you take as a result of receiving
that notification?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I went immediately to the emergency room at Parkland Hospital.
I was in the laboratory at Southwestern Medical School when this word reached
me by phone from the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at approximately what time did you then arrive at the
emergency room?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I would estimate it took a minute and a half to two minutes, so
I would guess that I arrived approximately 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was present, if anyone, upon your arrival, attending
to the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Jenkins, that is M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins, I suppose I ought to say, Dr.
Ronald Jones, Dr. Malcolm Perry, Dr. James Carrico; arriving either with me
or immediately thereafter were Dr. Robert McClelland, Dr. Paul Peters, and
Dr. Charles Baxter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe the President's condition to be on your
arrival there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. The President was lying on his back on the emergency cart. Dr.
Perry was performing a tracheotomy. There were chest tubes being inserted.
Dr. Jenkins was assisting the President's respirations through a tube in his
trachea. Dr. Jones and Dr. Carrico were administering fluids and blood intravenously.
The President was making a few spasmodic respiratory efforts. I
assisted in withdrawing the endotracheal tube from the throat as Dr. Perry
was then ready to insert the tracheotomy tube. I then examined the President
briefly.</p>

<p>My findings showed his pupils were widely dilated, did not react to light,
and his eyes were deviated outward with a slight skew deviation.</p>

<p>I then examined the wound in the back of the President's head. This was a
large, gaping wound in the right posterior part, with cerebral and cerebellar
tissue being damaged and exposed. There was considerable blood loss evident
on the carriage, the floor, and the clothing of some of the people present. I
would estimate 1,500 cc. of blood being present.</p>

<p>As I was examining the President's wound, I felt for a carotid pulse and
felt none. Therefore, I began external cardiac massage and asked that a
cardiotachioscope be connected. Because of my position it was difficult to
administer cardiac massage. However, Dr. Jones stated that he felt a femoral
pulse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is a femoral pulse?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. A femoral artery is the main artery going to the legs, and at
the junction of the leg and the trunk you can feel the arterial pulsation in
this artery. Because of my position, cardiac massage was taken over by Dr.
Malcolm Perry, who was more advantageously situated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did the cardiotachioscope show at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. By this time the cardiotachioscope, we just call it a cardiac
monitor for a better <span class="locked">word&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's a good word.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. The cardiotachioscope had been attached and Dr. Fouad Bashour
had arrived. There was transient electrical activity of the President's heart
of an undefined type. Approximately, at this time the external cardiac massage
became ineffectual and no pulsations could be felt. At this time it was decided
to pronounce the President dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time was this fixed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Death was fixed at 1 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that a precise time or an approximate time, or in what
way did you fix the time of death at 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. This was an approximation as it is, first, extremely difficult to
state precisely when death occurs. Secondly, no one was monitoring the
clock, so an approximation of 1 o'clock was chosen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was it who actually fixed the time of death?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you have any part in the filling out of the death
certificate?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do with respect to that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I filled out the death certificate at the request of Dr. George
Burkley, the President's physician at the White House, signed the death certificate
as a registered physician in the State of Texas, and gave this to him to
accompany the body to Washington.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you advise anyone else in the Presidential party of the
death of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; I told Mrs. Kennedy, the President's wife, of his death.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, if anything, did she respond to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. She told me that she knew it and thanked me for our efforts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any bullets or parts of bullets found in the President's
body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Not by me, nor did I see any such missiles recovered at Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you a part of any press conference which followed on
the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who made the arrangements for the press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Mr. Malcolm Kilduff, the Presidential press secretary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time did the press conference occur?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Approximately 2:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was it held?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. It was held in room 101&ndash;102, Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What mechanical instruments were used, if any, by the press
at the conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Tape recorders and television cameras, as well as the usual note
pads and pencils, and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was interviewed during the course of the press conference
and photographed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Malcolm Perry and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No one else?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, did you say then in the course of that press
conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I described the President's wound in his head in very much the
same way as I have described it here. I was asked if this wound was an
entrance wound, an exit wound, or what, and I said it could be an exit wound,
but I felt it was a tangential wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which wound did you refer to at this time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. The wound in the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you describe at that time what you meant by "tangential"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What definition of "tangential" did you make at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. As I remember, I defined the word "tangential" as being&mdash;striking
an object obliquely, not squarely or head on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe at this time in somewhat greater detail the
consequences of a tangential wound as contrasted with another type of a
striking?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Let me begin by saying that the damage suffered by an organ when
struck by a bullet or other <span class="locked">missile&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that I interrupted the deposition for about
2 minutes to ascertain what our afternoon schedule would be here because the
regular administration office ordinarily closes at 12 o'clock, which was just about
15 minutes ago, and then we resumed the deposition of Dr. Clark as he was discussing
the concept of tangential and other types of striking.</p>

<p>Go ahead, Doctor.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. The effects of any missile striking an organ or a function of the
energy which is shed by the missile in passing through this organ when a bullet
strikes the head, if it is able to pass through rapidly without shedding any
energy into the brain, little damage results, other than that part of the brain
which is directly penetrated by the missile. However, if it strikes the skull
at an angle, it must then penetrate much more bone than normal, therefore, is
likely to shed more energy, striking the brain a more powerful blow.</p>

<p>Secondly, in striking the bone in this manner, it may cause pieces of the bone
to be blown into the brain and thus act as secondary missiles. Finally, the
bullet itself may be deformed and deflected so that it would go through or
penetrate parts of the brain, not in the usual direct line it was proceeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, referring back to the press conference, did you define a
tangential wound at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what else did you state at the press conference at 2:30
on November 22?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I stated that the President had lost considerable blood, that one
of the contributing causes of death was this massive blood loss, that I was unable
to state how many wounds the President had sustained or from what angle
they could have come.</p>

<p>I finally remember stating that the President's wound was obviously a massive
one and was insurvivable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Dr. Perry say at that time, during the course of that
press conference, when the cameras were operating?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. As I recall, Dr. Perry stated that there was a small wound in
the President's throat, that he made the incision for the tracheotomy through
this wound. He discovered that the trachea was deviated so he felt that the
missile had entered the President's chest. He asked for chest tubes then to be
placed in the pleural cavities. He was asked if this wound in the throat was
an entrance wound or an exit wound. He said it was small and clean so it
could have been an entrance wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything else that you can recollect now in response
to the question of whether it was a wound of entrance or exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; I cannot recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you a part of a second press conference, Dr. Clark?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did that second press conference occur?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. On Saturday, the 23d.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Sometime in the morning, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Going back to the first press conference for just a minute, which
television networks were involved on that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Without sounding facetious, everyone, including some I had never
heard of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you recollect any besides the three major networks&mdash;ABC,
CBS, and NBC?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. This is all I remember. I remember seeing in the room two reporters
from Dallas newspapers whom I know and the radio and television
stations were also present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, going back to the second conference which I had started
asking you about, had you had an opportunity to tell me what time of day that
was?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. It was in the morning, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what television stations or networks were involved in that
conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Again, all three major networks, and I believe through our local
affiliates. It does not seem as though this one was as jammed and as full as the
first one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who arranged that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That press conference was arranged by Mr. Steve Landregan,
assistant administrator and public relations officer for the hospital. This is his
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who spoke at that press conference while the television
cameras were grinding?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Perry and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you say at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Essentially the same thing as I had on the first press conference,
again defining tangential, and again describing the President's wound as being
massive and unsurvivable.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did Dr. Perry, at that time, say?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Perry said very little. He described the President's condition
as he first saw him, when he was first called, and he described the manner in
which he was called to the emergency room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything about whether the neck wound was a point
of entry or exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I do not remember&mdash;I specifically discussed this&mdash;may I add something
to what I said in the first press conference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; please do, if you find something that comes to mind, please
feel free to add that.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. All right. Let me check what I remember Dr. Perry said at the
first press conference. He was asked if the neck wound could be a wound of
entrance or appeared to be a wound of exit, and Dr. Perry said something like
"possibly or conceivably," or something of this sort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, did he elaborate as to how that projectory would have been
possible in that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He did not elaborate on this. One of the reporters with gestures
indicated the direction that such a bullet would have to take, and Dr. Perry
quite obviously had to agree that this is the way it had to go to get from there
to the top of his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But that was a possible trajectory under the circumstances?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How would that have been postulated in terms of striking specific
parts of the body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Well, on a speculation, this would mean that the missile would
have had to have been fired from below&mdash;upward or that the President was
hanging upside down.</p>

<p>Me. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Dr. Perry discuss anything with you prior to that second
conference about a telephone call from Washington, D.C.?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you relate briefly what Dr. Perry told you about that
subject?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; Dr. Perry stated that he had talked to the Bethesda Naval
Hospital on two occasions that morning and that he knew what the autopsy
findings had shown and that he did not wish to be questioned by the press, as
he had been asked by Bethesda to confine his remarks to that which he knew
from having examined the President, and suggested that the major part of this
press conference be conducted by me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anyone else present when he expressed those thoughts
to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I believe that Mr. Price and Dr. Shires were present. I could
be wrong on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were you a part of a third press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did that occur?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. During the following week&mdash;I have forgotten exactly the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what networks were involved at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. It was CBS.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that a television conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; this was filmed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who arranged that conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Again, Mr. Landregan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who spoke at that conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Shaw, Dr. Shires, Dr. Baxter, Dr. McClelland, Dr. Jenkins,
Dr. Gieseke, and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Dr. Perry there at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; Dr. Perry was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly what you said at that time, if it
differed in any way from what you said before?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; it did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Dr. Perry say at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Essentially the same thing that he had said before, describing
the wound in the throat, describing the condition of the President, how he was
called and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he comment at that time as to whether it was an entrance
wound or an exit wound or what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did Dr. Shaw say at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Shaw described Governor Connally's chest wound. He
described what was done for him, the operation in some detail. He described
the fact that Governor Connally was conscious up until the time he was
anesthetized in the operating room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did Dr. Shires say at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Shires described the wounds suffered by Oswald and what
was done in an attempt to save him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about Dr. Gieseke, what did he say?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Gieseke corroborated Dr. Shaw's statements regarding Governor
Connally's condition and his remaining conscious until he was anesthetized
by Dr. Gieseke.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Dr. Baxter say at that conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Baxter described President Kennedy's condition as he saw
it, stated that he had assisted in the placing in the chest tubes on President
Kennedy, and that he had been present at Oswald's operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Dr. Baxter describe the neck wound that President Kennedy
suffered with specific respect as to whether it was point of entry or exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I don't remember&mdash;I don't believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have we covered all the doctors who spoke at that press
conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Except Dr. Jenkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did Dr. Jenkins say at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Jenkins described being called to attend President Kennedy,
how he got there with his anesthesia machine, that he found an endotracheal
tube had already been inserted. He hooked up and he described the activities
in the emergency room, operating room No. 1, and he described the stopping
of the President's heart and the decision to pronounce him dead. He went
ahead to describe the operation on Mr. Oswald and the extent of blood loss,
etc., which he had sustained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were you involved in still a subsequent press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And with whom was that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. This was with NBC and was approximately 2 weeks after the
assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who arranged that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Mr. Landregan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was that filmed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, that was also filmed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who spoke at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I spoke alone as a representative of the department and so
stated in the conference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you say at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Essentially the same thing as had been stated before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were you a part of still another press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. The week after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And with whom was that press conference?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. With BBC.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who arranged that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Mr. Landregan, again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did anyone else participate in that press conference with
you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was that televised, filmed, or simply recorded?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. It was simply recorded.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you say at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Exactly the same thing as I have said at the previous conferences,
describing the President's condition, his wound, and what transpired
after I arrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At any of the press conferences were you asked about a hole
on the left side of the President's head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At which conference or conferences?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I was asked about this at the CBS conference and I stated that
I personally saw no such wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who asked you about it at that time, if you recall?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. The man who was conducting the conference. This was brought
up by one of the physicians, I think Dr. McClelland, that there was some discussion
of such a wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Dr. McClelland say that he had seen such a wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the origin, if you know, as to the inquiry on the
wound, that is, who suggested that there might have been a wound on the left
side?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I don't recall&mdash;I don't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had there been some comment that the priests made a comment
that there was a wound on the left side of the head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I heard this subsequently from one of the reporters who attended
the press conference with NBC.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were priests actually in trauma room 1?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were they in relation to the President at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. They were on the right side of the President's body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you described the massive wound at the top of the President's
head, with the brain protruding; did you observe any other hole or
wound on the President's head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe, to make my question very specific, a bullet
hole or what appeared to be a bullet hole in the posterior scalp, approximately
2.5 cm. laterally to the right, slightly above the external occipital protuberant,
measuring 15 by 6 mm.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; I did not. This could have easily been hidden in the
blood and hair.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any bullet wounds or any other wound on the
back side of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the President ever turned over while he was in the emergency
room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Not in my presence; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you leave before, with, or after all the other doctors
who were in attendance?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I left after all the other doctors who were in attendance, because
I stayed with Dr. Burkley until we had the death certificate signed and the
arrangements had been made to transport the President's body out of Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say Dr. Burkley or Buckley?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Dr. Burkley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's the President's private physician?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Clark, would your observations be consistent with some
other alleged facts in this matter, such as the presence of a lateral wound
measuring 15 by 6 mm. on the posterior scalp approximately 2.5 cm. laterally
to the right and slightly above the external occipital proturberant&mdash;that is to
say, could such a hole have been present without your observing it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, in the presence of this much destruction of skull and scalp
above such a wound and lateral to it and the brief period of time available for
examination&mdash;yes, such a wound could be present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The physicians, surgeons who examined the President at the
autopsy specifically, Commander James J. Humes, H-u-m-e-s (spelling); Commander
J. Thornton Boswell, B-o-s-w-e-l-l (spelling), and Lt. Col. Pierre A.
Finck, F-i-n-c-k (spelling), expressed the joint opinion that the wound which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
I have just described as being 15 by 6 mm. and 2.5 cm. to the right and slightly
above the external occipital protuberant was a point of entrance of a bullet
in the President's head at a time when the President's head was moved slightly
forward with his chin dropping into his chest, when he was riding in an open
car at a slightly downhill position. With those facts being supplied to them
in a hypothetical fashion, they concluded that the bullet would have taken
a more or less straight course, exiting from the center of the President's skull
at a point indicated by an opening from three portions of the skull reconstructed,
which had been brought to them&mdash;would those findings and those conclusions
be consistent with your observations if you assumed the additional facts which
I have brought to your attention, in addition to those which you have personally
observed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Clark, in the line of your specialty, could you comment as
to the status of the President with respect to competency, had he been able
to survive the head injuries which you have described and the total wound which
he had?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. This, of course, is a question of tremendous importance. Just
let me state that the loss of cerebrellar tissue would probably have been of minimal
consequence in the performance of his duties. The loss of the right occipital
and probably part of the right parietal lobes would have been of specific importance.
This would have led to a visual field deficit, which would have
interfered in a major way with his ability to read, not the interpretation of
reading matter per se, but the acquisition of information from the printed
page. He would have had specific difficulty with finding the next line in a book
or paper. This would have proven to be a specific handicap in getting information
on which, as the President of the United States, he would have to act.</p>

<p>How much damage he would have had to his motor system, that is, the ability
to control or coordinate his left extremities, I would not know. This conceivably
could have been a problem in enabling him to move about, to appear
in public, et cetera. Finally, and probably most important, since the brain, as
far as at its higher levels, largely as a unit, the loss of this much brain tissue
likely would have impaired his ability in abstract reasoning, imagination;
whereas, the part of the President's brain struck is not that part specifically
concerned with these matters. The effect of loss of considerable brain tissue
does affect the total performance of the organ in these matters. There would
be grave doubts in my mind as to our ability as physicians to give a clear
answer regarding his ability to function as President of the United States.</p>

<p>Our ability to judge this is sometimes sorely tried when dealing with people
with considerably less intellectual and moral demands made upon them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor, did you prepare certain written reports based on your
participation in the treatment of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I now show you a document which has been supplied to
the President's Commission, which we have marked as Commission Exhibit
No. 392, and I now show you the second and third sheets, which purport to
be the summary made by you and ask if that was prepared by you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, are the facts set forth in those two sheets true and
correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I now show you a 2¾-page summary which purports to
bear your signature, being dated November 22, 1963, and I ask you if that, in
fact, is your signature?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, was, in fact, this report made in your own hand concerning
the treatment which you rendered to the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the facts set forth therein true and correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you made any other written report or other writings of
any sort concerning this matter?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been interviewed or discussed this matter with any
Federal representative prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And whom did you talk to?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I talked to an FBI agent a few days after the assassination,
in Mr. Jack Price's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who is Mr. Price, for the record at this point?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. He is the administrator of Parkland Memorial Hospital. This
agent asked me if I had recovered any missiles or fragments of missiles from
the President's body. I said I did not, and he asked me if I knew of anyone in
Parkland Hospital who had recovered such evidence and I assured him I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he ask you anything further?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you tell him anything further?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir. I offered to answer any questions he might have asked
and he said that was all he wished to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you talk to any other representative of the Federal
Government at any time before today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; I talked to a member of the Secret Service approximately
a month after the assassination. I talked to him on two occasions, once by
phone, and he asked me if I had a copy of the written report submitted by
Dr. Ronald Jones, and I told him I did not.</p>

<p>I subsequently talked to him in person. He showed me the summary that
I prepared and sent to Dr. Burkley, the same document I just identified
here, and my own handwritten report of the events of the afternoon of the
22d of November. He asked me if I prepared these and I told him I had. He
asked me if I had any other written records. I told him I did not. He said,
"Do you have any additional information than you have written?" I said
I did not. He thanked me very much for coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now summarized all of the conversations you have
had with any representative of the Federal Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you had any conversations with any representative
of the State government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before you were sworn in to have your deposition taken,
did you and I have a discussion about this matter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir; a pleasant discussion of what the function of this
Commission is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, also, all of what I would be asking once the record was
open and we started taking your deposition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have we covered on the record with the court reporter
transcribing all the subjects which you and I discussed informally and prior
to the start of the more formal session here?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything which you would care to add, which
you think might possibly be helpful to the Commission in any way, Dr. Clark?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir; I'm afraid I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for coming. We surely appreciate it,
Dr. Clark. Thank you, Dr. Clark.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t28"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_KEMP_CLARK_RESUMED" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_KEMP_CLARK_RESUMED">TESTIMONY OF DR. KEMP CLARK RESUMED</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Kemp Clark was taken at 12:05 p.m., on March 25, 1964,
at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Kemp Clark has returned to
have a few additional questions asked of him following the deposition which
was taken on March 21.</p>

<p>Dr. Clark, the purpose of this additional deposition is the same as the first
one, except that I am going to ask you a few additional questions based upon a
translation of an article which appeared in "L' Express", which has been provided
to me since the deposition of last Saturday.</p>

<p>Would you please stand up again and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the President's
Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Clark, I have made available to you, have I not, what
purports to be a translation from French of the "L' Express" issue of February
20, 1964?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And let me read for the record and for you this excerpt.</p>

<p>"On his part according to the New York Times of November 27, 'Dr. Kemp
Clark, who signed the Kennedy death certificate, declared that a bullet hit
him right where the knot of his necktie was.' He added," apparently referring
to you, "'this bullet penetrated into his chest and did not come out'. The
surgeon went on to say that the second wound of the President was 'tangential'
and that it had been caused by a bullet which hit 'the right side of his head'".</p>

<p>Dr. Clark, my first question is&mdash;what, if anything, did you say to a New
York Times representative or anyone, for that matter, with respect to whether
a bullet hit the President where the knot of his necktie was.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I remember using the phrase to describe the location of a wound
in the President's throat as being at the point of his knot of his necktie. I do
not recall ever specifically stating that this was an entrance wound, as has
been said before. I was not present when the President arrived and did not
see this wound. If any statement regarding its entrance or exit was made by
me, it was indicating that there was a small wound described there by the
physicians who first saw the President.</p>

<p>A specific quotation regarding entrance or exit, I feel, is a partial quotation
or incompletely quoted from me. The part pertaining to the bullet entering
the President's chest rests on the reasons for the placing of the chest tubes
which were being inserted when I arrived. It was the assumption, based on
the previously described deviation of the trachea and the presence of blood in
the strap muscles of the neck that a wound or missile wound might have entered
the President's chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, what was there, Dr. Clark, in the deviation of the trachea
and the presence of blood in the strap muscles of the neck which so indicated?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Assuming that a missile had entered the pleural space, if there
had been bleeding into the pleural space, the trachea would have been deviated
or had there been leakage of air into the pleural space, the trachea would have
been deviated, as it is the main conduit of air to the two lungs. Collapse of a
lung would have produced, or will produce deviation of the trachea. There
being a wound in the throat, there being blood in the strap muscles and there
being deviation of the trachea in the presence of a grievously wounded patient
without opportunity for X-ray or other diagnostic measures, Dr. Perry assumed
that the findings in the neck were due to penetration of the missile into the
chest. For this reason, he requested chest tubes to be placed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, is the deviation of the trachea and the presence of bleeding
on the strap muscles of the neck and the other factors which you have recited
equally consistent with a wound of exit on the neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir. Furthermore, let me say that the presence of the deviation
of the trachea, with blood in the strap muscles, are by no means diagnostic
of penetration of the chest, and the placing of the chest tubes was prophylactic
had such an eventuality occurred.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any external indication that there was a missile in
the chest?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it the preliminary thought that the missile might have been
in the chest by virtue of the fact that this wound was noted on the neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes; with the other factors I have enumerated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at that time, not knowing what the angle might have been
or any of the surrounding circumstances, then you proceeded to take precautionary
measures as if there might have been a missile in the chest at some
point?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That is correct. Measures were taken, assuming the worst had
happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As the quotation appears in the issue of "L' Express," "This
bullet penetrated into his chest and did not come out," would that then be an
accurate quotation of something that you said, Dr. Clark?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Clark, while you are here again, I would like to ask you a
few additional questions.</p>

<p>Let the record show that since I have taken your deposition, I have taken the
depositions of many additional witnesses and none has been transcribed, so I am
not in a position to refer to a record to see what I asked you before or to frankly
recollect precisely what I asked you before, so, to some extent these questions
may be overlapping.</p>

<p>Did you observe the President's back at that time when he was in the emergency
room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the reason for your not looking at his back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. First, the duration of time that the President was alive in the
emergency room was a brief duration. All efforts were bent toward saving his
life rather than inspection for precise location of wounds. After his death it was
not our position to try to evaluate all of the conceivable organs or areas of the
body, knowing that an autopsy would be performed and that this would be far
more meaningful than a cursory external examination here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any bleeding wound in the President's back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. In the back of his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But how about on the back of his body, was there any bleeding
wound noted?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Since we did not turn the President over, I cannot answer that
specifically. We saw none, as I previously stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you undertake any action to ascertain whether there had
been a violation to a major extent of the back part of his body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is, none was taken by you personally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Carrico testified earlier today, being the first doctor to reach
him, that he felt the President's back to determine whether there was any major
violation of that area.</p>

<p>Would that be a customary action to take to ascertain whether there was any
major wound, by the doctor who first examined the patient?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Assuming that the President had a bullet wound of entry on the
upper right posterior thorax, just above the upper border of the scapula, 14 cms.
from the right acromion process, 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid
process, would there have been a bloody type wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. I'm sorry&mdash;your question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would such a wound of entry by a missile traveling approximately
2,000 feet per second, approximately 6.5 mm. in diameter, cause a bloody
type of a wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir. Such a wound could have easily been overlooked in the
presence of the much larger wound in the right occipital region of the President's
skull, from which considerable blood loss had occurred which stained the back
of his head, neck and upper shoulders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Clark, I want to ask you a question as it is raised here in
"L' Express".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
"How did the practitioner who signed the death certificate of the President
fail to take the trouble to turn him over?"</p>

<p>Of course, that refers to you and will you give me your answer to that
question, as the news media has posed it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Quite simply, as I previously stated, the duration of time the
President was alive was occupied by attempts to save his life. When these
failed, further examination of the patient's body was not done, as it was felt
that little could be gained or learned that would be helpful in deciding the
course of events leading up to his assassination, that is, examination by me, as
I knew an autopsy would be performed which would be far more meaningful
and revealing than any cursory external examination conducted in the emergency
room by me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, was the action taken by you in signing the death certificate
based upon the examination which you made in accordance with what you
believed to be good medical practice?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that the characterization here of "L' Express" that the
failure to turn the President over would not constitute gross negligence in your
professional judgment, as they have characterized it here.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir. One other point, if I may here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. In order to move the President's body to Bethesda where the
autopsy was to be performed, a death certificate had to be filled out in conformance
with Texas State law to allow the body to be transported. This is the
second part of the signing of the death certificate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add, Dr. Clark, which you think might
be helpful at all in the inquiry being made by the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you and I chat for just a moment or two about the questions
I would ask you on this supplemental deposition before it went on the
record?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you talked to any representative of the Federal
Government between the time I took your deposition last Saturday and this
Wednesday morning?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. Clark.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Clark</span>. All right.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Robert Nelson McClelland was taken on March 21, 1964,
at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give in these
proceedings will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, the purpose of this proceeding is to take your
deposition in connection with an investigation which is being conducted by
the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, and
the specific purpose of our requesting you to answer questions relates to the
topic of the medical care which President Kennedy received at Parkland
Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Dr. McClelland, will you tell us your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Robert Nelson McClelland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you received a letter from the Commission which enclosed
a copy of the Executive order creating the Commission, and a copy of the
Congressional Resolution pertaining to the Commission, and a copy of the procedures
for taking testimony under the Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is it satisfactory with you to answer these questions for
us today, even though you haven't had the 3 days between the time of the
receipt of the letter and today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I am a doctor of medicine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly your educational background, starting
with your graduation from college, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Since graduation from college I attended medical school
at the University of Texas, medical branch in Galveston, Tex., and received the
M.D. degree from that school in 1954. I then went to Kansas City, Kans., where
I did a rotating internship at the University of Kansas Medical Center from
June 1954 to June 1955. Following that period I was a general medical officer
in the Air Force for 2 years in Germany, and subsequent to my release from
active duty, I became a general surgery resident at Parkland Memorial Hospital
in Dallas in August of 1957. I remained at Parkland from that date to
August 1959, at which time I entered private practice for ten months, and
then reentered my general surgery training program at Parkland in June 1960.
I completed my 4 years of general surgical training in June 1962. Following
that time I became a full-time instructor of surgery on the staff of the University
of Texas, Southwestern Medical School, and I am at the present time
an associate professor of surgery at that school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, in connection with your duties at Parkland
Hospital, or before, have you had any experience with gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where in your background did you acquire that experience?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Largely during residency training and subsequent to that
in my capacity here on the staff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what has provided the opportunity for your experience
here at Parkland in residency training and on the staff with respect to acquiring
knowledge of gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Largely this has been related to the type of hospital which
Parkland is; namely, City-County Hospital which receives all of the indigent
patients of this county, many of whom are involved frequently in shooting altercations,
so that we do see a large number of that type patient almost daily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you approximate for me the total number of gunshot
wounds which you have had an opportunity to observe?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I would estimate that it would be in excess of 200.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your duty assignment back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. At that time I was showing a film on surgical techniques
to a group of students and residents on the second floor of Parkland Hospital
in the surgical suite, where I was notified of the fact that President Kennedy
was being brought to the Parkland emergency room after having been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action, if any, did you take following that notification?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Immediately upon hearing that, I accompanied the Resident,
Dr. Crenshaw, who brought this news to me, to the emergency room, and
down to the trauma room 1 where President Kennedy had been taken immediately
upon arrival.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And approximately what time did you arrive in Emergency
Room 1?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. This is a mere approximation, but I would approximate
or estimate, rather, about 12:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was present, if anyone, at the time of your arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. At the time I arrived, Dr. Perry&mdash;would you like the full
names of all these?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would be fine, I would appreciate that.</p>

Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Dr. Malcolm Perry, Dr. Charles Baxter, Dr. Charles Crenshaw,
Dr. James Carrico, Dr. Paul Peters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were they all present at the time you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. They were not present when I arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you start with the ones who were present?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Starting with the ones who were present, I'm sorry, the
ones who were present when I arrived were Drs. Carrico, Perry and Baxter.
The others I mentioned arrived subsequently or about the same time that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, what other doctors, if any, arrived after you did, in
addition to those whom you have already mentioned?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. In addition, the ones that arrived afterwards, were Dr.
Kenneth Salyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. S-a-l-y-e-r?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. S-a-l-y-e-r, Dr. Fouad, F-o-u-a-d Bashour, Dr. Donald <span class="locked">Seldin----</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. S-e-l-d-i-n?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. S-e-l-d-i-n&mdash;I believe that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to President Kennedy's condition at
that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Well, on initially coming into the room and inspecting him
from a distance of only 2 or 3 feet as I put on a pair of surgical gloves, it
was obvious that he had sustained a probably mortal head injury, and that
his face was extremely swollen and suffused with blood appeared <span class="locked">cyanotic&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. "Cyanotic"&mdash;may I interrupt&mdash;just what do you mean by that in
lay terms?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. This mean bluish discoloration, bluish-black discoloration
of the tissue. The eyes were somewhat protuberant, which is usually seen
after massive head injuries denoting increased intracranial pressure, and it
seemed that he perhaps was not making, at the time at least, spontaneous respiratory
movements, but was receiving artificial respiration from a machine, an
anesthesia machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was operating that machine?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. The machine&mdash;there was a changeover, just as I came in, one
of the doctors in the room, I don't recall which one, had been operating what
we call an intermittent positive pressure breathing machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had that machine been utilized prior to your arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. It was in use as I arrived, yes, and about the same time I
arrived&mdash;this would be one other doctor who came in the room that I forgot
about&mdash;Dr. Jenkins, M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins, professor of anesthesiology, came into
the room with a larger anesthesia machine, which is a better type machine
with which to maintain control of respiration, and this was then attached to
the tube in the President's tracheotom; anyway, respiratory movements were
being made for him with these two machines, which were in the process of
being changed when I came in.</p>

<p>Then, as I took my post to help with the tracheotomy, I was standing at
the end of the stretcher on which the President was lying, immediately at
his head, for purposes of holding a tracheotom, or a retractory in the neck line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe, if anything, as to the status of the neck
wound when you first arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. The neck wound, when I first arrived, was at this time
converted into a tracheotomy incision. The skin incision had been made by
Dr. Perry, and he told me&mdash;although I did not see that&mdash;that he had made the
incision through a very small, perhaps less than one quarter inch in diameter
wound in the neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall whether he described it any more precisely than
that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. He did not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Has he ever described it any more precisely for you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. He has since that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what description has he given of it since that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. As well as I can recall, the description that he gave was
essentially as I have just described, that it was a very small injury, with clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
cut, although somewhat irregular margins of less than a quarter inch in diameter,
with minimal tissue damage surrounding it on the skin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, was there anything left for you to observe of that bullet
wound, or had the incision obliterated it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. The incision had obliterated it, essentially, the skin portion,
that is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Before proceeding to describe what you did in connection with
the tracheostomy, will you more fully describe your observation with respect to
the head wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. As I took the position at the head of the table that I have
already described, to help out with the tracheotomy, I was in such a position
that I could very closely examine the head wound, and I noted that the right
posterior portion of the skull had been extremely blasted. It had been shattered,
apparently, by the force of the shot so that the parietal bone was protruded
up through the scalp and seemed to be fractured almost along its right
posterior half, as well as some of the occipital bone being fractured in its
lateral half, and this sprung open the bones that I mentioned in such a way
that you could actually look down into the skull cavity itself and see that
probably a third or so, at least, of the brain tissue, posterior cerebral tissue and
some of the cerebellar tissue had been blasted out. There was a large amount
of bleeding which was occurring mainly from the large venous channels in the
skull which had been blasted open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he alive at the time you first saw him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I really couldn't say, because as I mentioned in the hectic
activity&mdash;I really couldn't say what his blood pressure was or what his pulse
was or anything of that sort. The only thing I could say that would perhaps
give evidence&mdash;this is not vital activity&mdash;at most, is that maybe he made one
or two spontaneous respiratory movements but it would be difficult to say, since
the machine was being used on him, whether these were true spontaneous respirations
or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you now describe the activity and part that you performed
in the treatment which followed your arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes; as I say, all I did was simply assist Dr. Perry and
Dr. Baxter in doing the tracheotomy. All three of us worked together in
making an incision in the neck, tracting the neck muscles out of the way, and
making a small opening into the trachea near the spot where the trachea had
already been blasted or torn open by the fragment of the bullet, and inserting
a large metal tracheotomy tube into this hole, and after this the breathing
apparatus was attached to this instead of the previous tube which had been
placed here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In conducting that operation, did you observe any interior
damage to the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe that for me, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. That damage consisted mainly of a large amount of contusion
and hematoma formation in the tissue lateral to the right side of the
trachea and the swelling and bleeding around this site was to such extent
that the trachea was somewhat deviated to the left side, not a great deal, but to
a degree at least that it required partial cutting of some of the neck muscles in
order to get good enough exposure to put in the tracheotomy tube, but there was
a good deal of soft tissue damage and damage to the trachea itself where apparently
the missile had gone between the trachea on the right side and the strap
muscles which were applied closely to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What other treatment was given to President Kennedy at the
time you were performing the procedures you have just described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. To the best of my knowledge, the other treatment had
consisted of the placement of cutdown sites in his extremities, namely, the making
of incisions over large veins in the arms and, I believe, in the leg; however,
I'm not sure about that, since I was not paying too much attention to that part
of the activity, and large plastic tubes were placed into these veins for the
giving of blood and fluids, and as I recall, he received a certain amount of blood,
but I don't know exactly how much, since I was not actually giving the blood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
In addition to that, of course, while we were working on the tracheotomy
incision, the other physicians that I have mentioned were attaching the President
rapidly to a cardiac monitor, that is to say, an electrocardiogram, for
checking the presence of cardiac activity, and in addition, chest tubes were
being placed in the right and left chest&mdash;both, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall who was placing those tubes?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. One of the tubes, I believe, was placed by Dr. Peters. The
other one, I'm not right certain, I don't really recall&mdash;I perhaps better not say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know about how long that took in placing those chest
tubes?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. As well as I am aware, the tubes were both placed in.
What this involves is simply putting a trocar, a large hollow tube, and that is
put into the small incision, into the anterior chest wall and slipping the tube
into the chest between a group of ribs for purposes of relieving any collection of
air or fluid which is present in the lungs. The reason this was done was
because it was felt that there was probably quite possibly a mediastinal injury
with perhaps suffusion of blood and air into one or both pleural cavities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What effect did this medical treatment have on President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. As near as we could tell, unfortunately, none. We felt that
from the time we saw him, most of us agreed, all of us agreed rather, that this
was a mortal wound, but that in spite of this feeling that all attempts possible
should be made to revive him, as far as establishing the airway breathing for
him, and replacing blood and what not, but unfortunately the loss of blood and
the loss of cerebral and cerebellar tissues were so great that the efforts were of
no avail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he conscious at that time that you saw him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, at what time did he expire?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. He was pronounced dead at 1 p.m. on November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the cause of death in your opinion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. The cause of death, I would say, would be massive head
injuries with loss of large amounts of cerebral and cerebellar tissues and
massive blood loss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe anything in the nature of a wound on his body
other than that which you have already described for me?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what position was President Kennedy maintained from the
time you saw him until the pronouncement of death?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. On his back on the cart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On his what?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. On his back on the stretcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he on the stretcher at all times?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In the trauma room No. 1 you described, is there any table onto
which he could be placed from the stretcher?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No; generally we do not move patients from the stretcher
until they are ready to go into the operating room and then they are moved onto
the operating table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, in fact, was he left on the stretcher all during the course
of these procedures until he was pronounced dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, at any time was he positioned in a way where you could
have seen the back of his body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any gunshot wound on his back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had discussions with the other doctors who attended
President Kennedy as to the possible nature of the wound which was inflicted
on him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what facts did you have available either to you or to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
other doctors whom you talked this over with, with respect to the nature of the
wound, source of the wounds, and that sort of thing?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Immediately we had essentially no facts. We knew nothing
of the number of bullets that had supposedly been fired. We knew nothing
of the site from which the bullet had been fired, essentially none of the circumstances
in the first few minutes, say, 20 or 30 minutes after the President
was brought in, so that our initial impressions were based upon extremely
incomplete information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your initial impressions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. The initial impression that we had was that perhaps the
wound in the neck, the anterior part of the neck, was an entrance wound and
that it had perhaps taken a trajectory off the anterior vertebral body and
again into the skull itself, exiting out the back, to produce the massive injury
in the head. However, this required some straining of the imagination to
imagine that this would happen, and it was much easier to explain the apparent
trajectory by means of two bullets, which we later found out apparently had
been fired, than by just one then, on which basis we were originally taking
to explain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Through the use of the pronoun "we" in your last answer, to
whom do you mean by "we"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Essentially all of the doctors that have previously been
mentioned here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe the condition of the back of the President's
head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Well, partially; not, of course, as I say, we did not lift
his head up since it was so greatly damaged. We attempted to avoid moving
him any more than it was absolutely necessary, but I could see, of course,
all the extent of the wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You saw a large opening which you have already described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I saw the large opening which I have described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any other wound on the back of the head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe a small gunshot wound below the large opening
on the back of the head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Based on the experience that you have described for us with
gunshot wounds and your general medical experience, would you characterize
the description of the wound that Dr. Perry gave you as being a wound of
entrance or a wound of exit, or was the description which you got from Dr.
Perry and Dr. Baxter and Dr. Carrico who were there before, equally consistent
with whether or not it was a wound of entrance or a wound of exit, or how
would you characterize it in your words?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I would say it would be equally consistent with either type
wound, either an entrance or an exit type wound. It would be quite difficult
to say&mdash;impossible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, I show you now a statement or a report which
has been furnished to the Commission by Parkland Hospital and has been identified
in a previous Commission hearing as Commission Exhibit No. 392, and I
direct your attention specifically to a page, "Third Report", which was made
by you, and I would ask you first of all if this is your signature which appears
at the bottom of Page 2, and next, whether in fact you did make this report
and submit it to the authorities at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are all the facts set forth true and correct to the best
of your knowledge, information and belief?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. To the best of my knowledge, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, did you and I sit down together for just a few
minutes before I started to take your deposition today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I discussed this matter with you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, during the course of our conversations at that time, did
we cover the same material in question form here and to which you have
responded in answer form with the court reporter here today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And has the information which you have given me on the
record been the same as that which you gave me off of the record in advance?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any interest, Dr. McClelland in reading your
testimony over or signing it at the end, or would you be willing to waive any
such signature of the testimony?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I would be willing to waive my signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you so much for coming and giving us your deposition
today.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t36"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_ROBERT_M_McCLELLAND_RESUMED" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_ROBERT_M_McCLELLAND_RESUMED">TESTIMONY OF DR. ROBERT M. McCLELLAND RESUMED</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Robert M. McClelland was taken at 3:25 p.m., on
March 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Robert M. McClelland has returned
to have a brief additional deposition concerning a translation of "L' Express"
which has been called to my attention in the intervening time which has
elapsed between March 21, when I took Dr. McClelland's deposition on the
first occasion, and today.</p>

<p>Dr. McClelland, will you raise your right hand? Do you solemnly swear
that the testimony you will give to the President's Commission in this deposition
proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help
you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, I show you a translation from the French, of
the magazine, "L' Express" issue of February 20, 1964, and ask you if you
would read this item, with particular emphasis on a reference to a quotation
or statement made by you to a reporter from the St. Louis Post Dispatch.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. (Examined instrument referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you had an opportunity to read over that excerpt?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to a reporter from the St. Louis Post Dispatch
about this matter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was his name?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Richard Dudman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did you have that conversation with Mr. Dudman?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. As well as I recall, it was the day after the assassination,
as nearly as I can recall, but I'm not certain about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you tell me as closely as you remember what he said to
you and you said to him, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. The main point he seemed to be making was to attempt to
define something about the wound, the nature of the wound, and as near as
I can recall, I indicated to him that the wound was a small undamaged&mdash;appearing
punctate area in the skin of the neck, the anterior part of the
neck, which had the appearance of the usual entrance wound of a bullet, but
that this certainly could not be&mdash;you couldn't make a statement to that effect
with any complete degree of certainty, though we were, as I told him, experienced
in seeing wounds of this nature, and usually felt that we could tell the difference
between an entrance and an exit wound, and this was, I think, in essence
what I told him about the nature of the wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, had you actually observed the wound prior to the time
the tracheotomy was performed on that neck wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No; my knowledge of the entrance wound, as I stated, in my
former deposition, was merely from what Dr. Perry told me when I entered the
room and began putting on a pair of surgical gloves to assist with the
tracheotomy.</p>

<p>Dr. Perry looked up briefly and said that they had made an incision and
were in the process of making an incision in the neck, which extended through
the middle of the wound in question in the front of the neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you have just characterized it in that last answer as
an entrance wound.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Well, perhaps I shouldn't say the wound anyway, not the
entrance wound&mdash;that might be a slip of the tongue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have a firm opinion at this time as to whether it is
an entrance wound or exit wound or whatever?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Of course, my opinion now would be colored by everything
that I've heard about it and seen since, but I'll say this, if I were simply looking
at the wound again and had seen the wound in its unchanged state, and
which I did not, and, of course, as I say, it had already been opened up by the
tracheotomy incision when I saw the wound&mdash;but if I saw the wound in its
state in which Dr. Perry described it to me, I would probably initially think this
were an entrance wound, knowing nothing about the circumstances as I did
at the time, but I really couldn't say&mdash;that's the whole point. This would
merely be a calculated guess, and that's all, not knowing anything more than
just seeing the wound itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But did you, in fact, see the wound prior to the time the incision
was made?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that any preliminary thought you had even, would be based
upon what you had been told by Dr. Perry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you tell Mr. Dudman of the St. Louis Post Dispatch
that you did not in fact see the wound in the neck, but your only information
of it came from what Dr. Perry had told you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I don't recall whether I told him that or not. I really
don't remember whether I said I had seen the wound myself or whether I was
merely referring to our sort of collective opinion of it, or whether I told him
I had not seen the wound and was merely going by Dr. Perry's report of it
to me. I don't recall now, this far away in time exactly what I said to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, I want to ask you a few additional questions,
and some of these questions may duplicate questions which I asked you last
Saturday, and the reason for that is, we have not yet had a chance to transcribe
the deposition of last Saturday, so I do not have before me the questions
I asked you at that time and the answers you gave, and since last
Saturday I have taken the depositions of many, many doctors on the same
topics, so it is not possible for me to be absolutely certain of the specific questions
which I asked you at that time, but permit me to ask you one or several
more questions on the subject.</p>

<p>First, how many bullets do you think were involved in inflicting the wounds
on President Kennedy which you observed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. At the present time, you mean, or at the immediate moment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, take the immediate moment and then the present time.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. At the moment, of course, it was our impression before we
had any other information from any other source at all, when we were just
confronted with the acute emergency, the brief thoughts that ran through our
minds were that this was one bullet, that perhaps entered through the front
of the neck and then in some peculiar fashion which we really had, as I mentioned
the other day, to strain to explain to ourselves, had coursed up the
front of the vertebra and into the base of the skull and out the rear of the
skull.</p>

<p>This would have been a very circuitous route for the bullet to have made, so
that when we did find later on what the circumstances were surrounding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
assassination, this was much more readily explainable to ourselves that the
two wounds were made by two separate bullets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your view or opinion today as to how many bullets
inflicted the injuries of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what would be the reason for your changing your opinion
in that respect?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Oh, just simply the later reports that we heard from all
sources, of all the circumstances surrounding the assassination. Certainly no
further first-hand information came to me and made me change my mind
in that regard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, let me ask you to assume a few additional facts,
and based on a hypothetical situation which I will put to you and I'll ask you
for an opinion.</p>

<p>Assume, if you will, that President Kennedy was shot on the upper right
posterior thorax just above the upper border of the scapula at a point 14 cm.
from the tip of the right acromion process and 14 cm. below a tip of the right
mastoid process, assume further that that wound of entry was caused by a
6.5-mm. missile shot out of a rifle having a muzzle velocity of approximately
2,000 feet per second, being located 160 to 250 feet away from President Kennedy,
that the bullet entered on the point that I described on the President's
back, passed between two strap muscles on the posterior aspect of the President's
body and moved through the fascial channel without violating the pleura
cavity, and exited in the midline lower third anterior portion of the President's
neck, would the hole which Dr. Perry described to you on the front side of
the President's neck be consistent with the hole which such a bullet might make
in such a trajectory through the President's body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what would your reasoning be for thinking that that would
be a possible hole of exit on those factors as I have outlined them to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Well, I think my reasoning would be basically that the
missile was traveling mainly through soft tissue, rather than exploding from
a bony chamber and that by the time it reached the neck that it had already
lost, because of the distance from which it was fired, even though the muzzle
velocity was as you stated&mdash;would have already lost a good deal of its initial
velocity and kinetic strength and therefore would have perhaps made, particularly,
if it were a fragment of the bullet as bullets do sometimes fragment, could
have made a small hole like this in exiting. It certainly could have done that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would have happened then to the other portion of the
bullet if it had fragmented?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. It might have been left along, or portions of it along the
missile track&mdash;sometimes will be left scattered up and down this. Other fragments
will maybe scatter in the wound and sometimes there will be multiple
fragments and sometimes maybe only a small fragment out of the main bullet,
sometimes a bullet will split in half&mdash;this is extremely difficult for me to say
just what would happen in a case like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, assuming this situation&mdash;that the bullet did not fragment,
because the autopsy report shows no fragmentation, that is, it cannot show the
absence of fragmentation, but we do know that there were no bullets left in the
body at any point, so that no fragment is left in.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. I think even then you could make the statement that this
wound could have resulted from this type bullet fired through this particular
mass of soft tissue, losing that much velocity before it exited from the body.
Where you would expect to see this really great hole that is left behind would
be, for instance, from a very high velocity missile fired at close range with a
heavy caliber bullet, such as a .45 pistol fired at close range, which would make
a small entrance hole, relatively, and particularly if it entered some portion of
the anatomy such as the head, where there was a sudden change in density from
the brain to the skull cavity, as it entered. As it left the body, it would still have
a great deal of force behind it and would blow up a large segment of tissue as
it exited. But I don't think the bullet of this nature fired from that distance
and going through this large area of homogenous soft tissue would necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
make the usual kind of exit wound like I just described, with a close range high
velocity heavy caliber bullet.</p>

<p>This is why it would be difficult to say with certainty as has been implied in
some newspaper articles that quoted me, that you could tell for sure that this was
an entrance or an exit wound. I think this was blown up a good deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, why wasn't the President's body turned over?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. The President's body was not turned over because the initial
things that were done as in all such cases of extreme emergency are to first
establish an airway and second, to stop hemorrhage and replace blood, so that
these were the initial things that were carried out immediately without taking
time to do a very thorough physical examination, which of course would have
required that these other emergency measures not be done immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any examination of the President's back at all?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was any examination of the President's back made to your
knowledge?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Not here&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be helpful
in any way to the Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No; I think not except again to emphasize perhaps that
some of our statements to the press about the nature of the wound may have
been misleading, possibly&mdash;probably because of our fault in telling it in such a
way that they misinterpreted our certainty of being able to tell entrance from
exit wounds, which as we say, we generally can make an educated guess about
these things but cannot be certain about them. I think they attributed too much
certainty to us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you talked to anyone from the Federal Government
about this matter since I took your deposition last Saturday?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you and I chat for a moment or two with my showing
you this translation of "L' Express" prior to the time we went on the record
here?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is the information which you gave to me in response to
my questions the same that we put on the record here?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. To the best of my knowledge&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. McClelland.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">McClelland</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Charles Rufus Baxter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. I am a medical doctor of surgery, general surgeon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline briefly your educational background?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. University of Texas&mdash;1948 through 1950. Southwestern Medical
School, 1950 through 1954, 1955 straight medicine internship, 1956 medicine
residency&mdash;internal medicine residency. 1956 through 1958, surgical research at
Brooke Army Medical Center, 1958 through 1964&mdash;surgical residency, and 1964
through the present&mdash;this is 1964, I got out of the Army&mdash;in 1958, 1958 through
1962&mdash;surgery residency, and 1962 until now, assistant professor of surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you board certified, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what boards have you passed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. The American Board of Surgeons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what year were you so certified?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your specific title at the medical school?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Assistant professor of surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to aid in the treatment of President Kennedy
at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And will you outline briefly the circumstances surrounding your
being called to render such assistance?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. I was conducting the student health service in the hours of 12
to 1 and was contacted there by the supervisor of the emergency room, who told
me that the President was on the way to the emergency room, having been shot.</p>

<p>I went on a dead run to the emergency room as fast as I could and it took me
about 3 or 4 minutes to get there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately what time did you arrive at the emergency room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. I think it was 12:40&mdash;thereabouts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was present at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Dr. Carrico and Dr. Jones and Dr. Jenkins&mdash;several nurses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify the nurses?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes; Mrs. Nelson&mdash;and who else? There were two or three
others whose names&mdash;Miss Henchliffe was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Miss Bowron?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Miss Bowron there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any other nurses there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. One or two more, but I'm not sure of their names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify any other doctors who were there at that
time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Oh, let's see&mdash;I'm not sure whether the others came before or
after I did. There was Crenshaw, Peters, and Kemp Clark, Dr. Bashour
finally came. I believe Jackie Hunt&mdash;yes&mdash;she was, I believe she was the anesthesiologist
who came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Dr. Don Curtis there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. I'm not sure&mdash;I just don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you arrived, what did you observe as to the condition of
the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. He was very obviously in extremis. There was a large gaping
wound in the skull which was covered at that time with blood, and its extent
was not immediately determined. His eyes were bulging, the pupils were fixed
and dilated and deviated outward, both pupils were deviated laterally. At
that time his breathing was being assisted so that whether he was breathing
on his own or not, I couldn't determine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what way was his breathing being assisted?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. With an anesthesia machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you continue to describe what you observed as to his
condition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. There were no pulses that I could feel present. The anesthesiologist
told me that he did still have a heartbeat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who is that who said that to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Well, I believe this was Carrico who said that his heart was still
beating. There was present at the time two intravenous catheters in place
with fluids running. We were informed at that time&mdash;well, having looked over
the rest of the body, the only other wound was in his neck, that we saw.</p>

<p>Dr. Carrico said that he had observed a tracheal laceration. At that moment
Dr. Jones, I believe, was placing in a left anterior chest tube because of this
information. We proceeded at that time with a tracheotomy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who performed the tracheotomy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Dr. Perry and myself, with the assistance of Dr. McClelland, and
I believe that's all&mdash;there may have been one more person that held the retractor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else, if anything, did you do for President Kennedy at
that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. During the tracheotomy, I helped with the insertion of a right
anterior chest tube, and then helped Dr. Perry complete the tracheotomy. At
that point none of us could hear a heartbeat present. Apparently this had ceased
during the tracheotomy and the chest tube placement.</p>

<p>We then gave him or Dr. Perry and Dr. Clark alternated giving him closed
chest cardiac massage only until we could get a cardioscope hooked up to
tell us if there were any detectible heartbeat electrically present, at least, and
there was none, and we discussed at that moment whether we should open the
chest to attempt to revive him, while the closed chest massage was going on,
and we had an opportunity to look at his head wound then and saw that the
damage was beyond hope, that is, in a word&mdash;literally the right side of his
head had been blown off. With this and the observation that the cerebellum
was present&mdash;a large quantity of brain was present on the cart, well&mdash;we felt
that such an additional heroic attempt was not warranted, and we did not pronounce
him dead but ceased our efforts, and awaited the priest and last rites
before we pronounced him dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the priest then arrive to perform the last rites?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time was he pronounced dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. As I recall, it was 1:08, I'm not sure, it may have been that that
was Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But it was approximately 1 o'clock? Then, could the time of
death be fixed with any precision?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. I don't think so&mdash;the time elapsing in all of this resuscitation
and the time the heart actually ceased, I don't think one could be very sure of it.
It was sometime between a quarter to 1 and 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described all of the efforts which were made to
save the life of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Only with the exception, I think, of the fluids that were administered.
He was given hydrocortisone because of his previous medical condition.
He was given no negative blood because the blood loss was rather fierce and,
I believe that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What other doctors arrived during the course of the treatment,
in addition to those whom you have already mentioned?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. I don't recall&mdash;I know that there were more doctors present in
the room, but their names, I'm not sure of. The reason I'm not sure is because
we had some of the same crew and a different crew on the Governor and on
Oswald, and I'm afraid that I've gotten them mixed up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you describe in as much particularity as you can the
nature of the head wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. The only wound that I actually saw&mdash;Dr. Clark examined this
above the manubrium of the sternum, the sternal notch. This wound was in
temporal parietal plate of bone laid outward to the side and there was a large
area, oh, I would say 6 by 8 or 10 cm. of lacerated brain oozing from this wound,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
part of which was on the table and made a rather massive blood loss mixed
with it and around it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any bullet hole below that large opening at the
top of the head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No; I personally did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe with as much particularity as you can the
wound which you noticed on the President's neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. The wound on the neck was approximately an inch and a half
above the manubrium of the sternum, the sternal notch. This wound was in
my estimation, 4 to 5 mm. in widest diameter and was a spherical wound. The
edges of it&mdash;the size of the wound is measured by the hole plus the damaged
skin around the area, so that it was a very small wound. And, it was directly
in the midline. Now, this wound was excised in the performance of the tracheotomy
and on the entry into the deeper tissues of the neck, there was considerable
contusion of the muscles of the anterior neck and a moderate amount
of bleeding around the trachea. The trachea was deviated slightly, I believe,
to the left.</p>

<p>Our tracheotomy incision was made in the second tracheal ring which was
immediately above the area of damage&mdash;where we thought the damaged area
of the trachea was, which we did not dissect out, but once the endrotracheal
tube was placed, the tracheotomy tube was placed into the trachea, it was
below this tear in the trachea, and gave us good control or perfect control of
respiration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the characteristics of the wound on the neck sufficient to
enable you to form an opinion with reasonable medical certainty as to what was
the cause of the hole?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Well, the wound was, I think, compatible with a gunshot wound.
It did not appear to be a jagged wound such as one would expect with a very
high velocity rifle bullet. We could not determine, or did not determine at that
time whether this represented an entry or an exit wound. Judging from the
caliber of the rifle that we later found or become acquainted with, this would
more resemble a wound of entry. However, due to the density of the tissues of
the neck and depending upon what a bullet of such caliber would pass through,
the tissues that it would pass through on the way to the neck, I think that the
wound could well represent either exit or entry wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Assuming some factors in addition to those which you personally
observed, Dr. Baxter, what would your opinion be if these additional facts were
present: First, the President had a bullet wound of entry on the right posterior
thorax just above the upper border of the scapula with the wound measuring 7
by 4 mm. in oval shape, being 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion process
and 14 cm. below the tip of the right mastoid process&mdash;assume this is the set of
facts, that the wound just described was caused by a 6.5 mm. bullet shot from
approximately 160 to 250 feet away from the President, from a weapon having
a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000 feet per second, assuming as a third
factor that the bullet passed through the President's body, going in between the
strap muscles of the shoulder without violating the pleura space and exited at
a point in the midline of the neck, would the hole which you saw on the President's
throat be consistent with an exit point, assuming the factors which I
have just given to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Although it would be unusual for a high velocity missile of this
type to cause a wound as you have described, the passage through tissue planes
of this density could have well resulted in the sequence which you outline;
namely, that the anterior wound does represent a wound of exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would be the considerations which, in your mind, would
make it, as you characterized it, unlikely?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. It would be unlikely because the damage that the bullet would
create would be&mdash;first its speed would create a shock wave which would damage
a larger number of tissues, as in its path, it would tend to strike, or usually
would strike, tissues of greater density than this particular missile did and
would then begin to tumble and would create larger jagged&mdash;the further it went,
the more jagged would be the damage that it created; so that ordinarily there
would have been a rather large wound of exit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But relating the situation as I hypothesized it for you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Then it is perfectly understandable that this wound of exit
was not of any greater magnitude than it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Baxter, is there a channel through which the bullet could
have passed in the general direction which I have described to you where there
would be very few tissues and virtually no tissues of great density?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes; passing through the fascial plane which you have described,
it could well not have these things happen to it, so that it would pass directly
through&mdash;almost as if passing through a sheet of paper and the wound of exit
would be no larger than the wound we saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would the situation there be as to the shock wave which
you have heretofore described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. There would be a large amount of tissue damage which is not
ordinarily seen immediately after a bullet has passed through. This is damage
that is recognized several days later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What causes the shock waves there, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. This is just the velocity imparting pressure to surrounding
tissues which damages them. It does not show, however, in the early course
after a missile has passed through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, would the shock waves have any effect upon the size, and
nature of the hole of exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And if the bullet passed through the fascial plane without striking
tissues of great density, would it have a tendency to tumble at all?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No, it would not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What has your experience been, if any, Doctor, with gunshot
wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. For the past 6 years&mdash;we admit and treat, I would estimate,
around 500 gunshot wounds per year&mdash;thereabouts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever had any formal training in gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Only that I received in the Army, with demonstration of various
velocities and that type missile wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was President Kennedy lying when you first saw him,
Dr. Baxter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. On the cart, on the emergency cart in trauma room 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he ever taken off of that cart from the time you first saw
him until the time he was pronounced dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he ever turned over?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would your examination have been conducted in any different
way had this particular victim not been the President of the United States?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. I think&mdash;yes&mdash;in that we would have, particularly, postmortem
examined the body much more carefully than we did. We would certainly
have undressed him completely and determined all of the direction of the wounds
at the time. This did not seem feasible under the circumstances.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why was it not feasible under the circumstances?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Mrs. Kennedy was in the room, there was a large number of
people in the room by that time&mdash;Secret Service Agents, the priests and so on.
As soon as the President was pronounced dead, the Secret Service more or less&mdash;well,
requested that we clear the room and leave them with the President's
body, which was done. Everything that the Secret Service wished was carried
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Everything that the Secret Service asked us to do, we did, as
rapidly as possible and this was one of their requests.</p>

<p>In addition, I must say that the emotional condition of all of us at that time
was such that probably we would not&mdash;we didn't feel that we should do any
more, since we were certain that autopsy would take care of all that we were
going to miss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the emotional situation have any effect in your professional
opinion on the quality of the medical care which was rendered to the President?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No; none at all. We, I think, everyone present in the room was
certainly emotionally involved in the care of the President, but in no instance
did I see less than the most meticulous and best judgment used in the care of
the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, in your opinion, was the cause of death, Dr. Baxter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Gunshot wound to the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you have an opinion as to whether or not President Kennedy
would have survived the gunshot wound which you observed in the neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. We saw no evidence that it had struck anything in the neck that
would not be well taken care of by simply&mdash;by the tracheotomy and chest tubes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you find any bullets in the President's body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No, we did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any fragments of bullets in the President's body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Baxter, I now show you Commission Exhibit 392, which has
been heretofore identified in Commission Proceedings as the report from Parkland
Memorial Hospital, and I now call your attention to a page which purports
to bear your signature, and a written report which you rendered under date of
November 22, 1963. I ask you, first of all, if that is your signature?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, if this is the report which you submitted?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any other writings or notes of any sort concerning
your care of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you read into the record, Dr. Baxter, the contents of your
report, because it is a little hard to read in spots?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. "I was contacted at approximately 12:40 that the President was
on the way to the Emergency Room, having been shot. On arrival there, I
found an endotracheal tube in place with assisted respirations, a left chest tube
being inserted, and cutdowns going in one leg and in the left arm.</p>

<p>The President had a wound in the midline of the neck. On first observation
of the remaining wounds, the temporal and parietal bones were missing and the
brain was lying on the table with extensive lacerations and contusions. The
pupils were fixed and deviated laterally and dilated. No pulse was detectable,
respirations were (as noted) being supplemented. A tracheotomy was performed
by Dr. Perry and I and a chest tube inserted into the right chest (second
interspace anteriorly). Meanwhile, 2 pints of O negative blood was administered
by pump without response. When all of these measures were complete, no
heartbeat could be detected, closed chest massage was performed until a cardioscope
could be attached, which revealed no cardiac activity was obtained.</p>

<p>Due to the extensive and irreparable brain damage which was detected, no
further attempt to resuscitate the heart was made."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And that bears your signature?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Charles R. Baxter, M.D., assistant professor of surgery, Southwestern
Medical School, University of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Baxter, has any representative of the Federal Government
ever talked to you about this matter prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. The only person was a Secret Service Agent about&mdash;approximately
three weeks ago who asked me if I had any additional written comments
anywhere or had made any writings on the medical treatment of the President,
and the answer was "No."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, prior to the time that the court reporter started to transcribe
my questions and your answers, did you and I briefly discuss this deposition
proceeding, its purpose and the questions which I would ask you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the answers given on the record here the same as you
gave me in our brief conversation before the transcription was started?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be helpful
in any way to the work of the Commission?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for coming, Dr. Baxter.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Baxter</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Marion Thomas Jenkins was taken at 5:30 p.m., on
March 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen
Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins has appeared in response
to a letter request in connection with the inquiry of the President's
Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, to testify concerning his
observations and medical treatment performed by him on President Kennedy,
and with this preliminary statement of purpose, would you stand up, please,
Dr. Jenkins, and raise your right hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before the President's Commission
in this deposition proceeding, will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Marion Thomas Jenkins.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. I'm a physician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you licensed by the State of Texas to practice medicine?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your specialty, Dr. Jenkins?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Anesthesiology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline your educational background for me, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. I am a graduate of the University of Texas in 1937. I have
a B.A. degree and an M.D. degree from the University of Texas Medical Branch
at Galveston in 1940, rotating internship at the University of Kansas Hospital,
Kansas City, Kans., 1940&ndash;41; Assistant Residency in Internal Medicine, John
Sealy Hospital in Galveston, Tex., 1941&ndash;42; active duty in the U.S. Navy as a
Medical Officer, 1942 to 1946; Resident in Surgery&mdash;Parkland Hospital, Dallas,
1946&ndash;47; Resident in anesthesiology in the Massachusetts General Hospital,
Boston, 1947&ndash;48; and Director of the Department of Anesthesiology, Parkland
Hospital and Parkland Memorial Hospital, 1948 to the present; Professor and
Chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology, University of Texas, Southwestern
Medical School&mdash;since 1951. Diplomate&mdash;other certification, do you
want this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, what Boards are you certified?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. I am a Diplomate of the American Board of Anesthesiology
and also fellow of the American College of Anesthesiologists.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what year were you certified by the American Board?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. 1952.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to assist in the treatment of President
Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your
being called into that case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, I was in the dining room with other members of the
hospital staff when we heard the Chief of Surgery, Dr. Tom Shires, being
paged "Stat." This is a rather unusual call, for the Chief of any service to be
called "Stat" as this is the emergency call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What does that mean, "Stat"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. "Stat" means emergency, that's just a code word that has been
used for years in medical terms. He was paged twice this way, and one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
surgical residents, Dr. Ronald Jones, answered the phone, thinking something
bad must be up and that he would call the Chief of Surgery. I was
sitting near the telephone and Dr. Jones immediately came back by with a
very anguished look and the color was drained from his face&mdash;I'm sure I had
that impression, and he said, "The President has been shot and is on his way to
the hospital." At the same time we heard the sirens of the ambulance as they
turned into the driveway from Harry Hines into the hospital drive, and it
was obvious that this was the car coming in because the ambulance sirens usually
stop in the street, but these came on clear to the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's Harry Hines Boulevard right in front of the hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes; I ran up the stairs to the Anesthesia Department, that's
on the second floor&mdash;one floor above the dining room, where I was, and notified
two members of the Department, the first two I saw, my Chief Associate, Dr.
A.&nbsp;H. Giesecke, Jr., and Dr. Jackie Hunt, that the President had been shot
and was being brought to the emergency room and for them to bring all
the resuscitative equipment we have including an anesthesia machine. The
emergency room is set up well, but we are used to working with our own equipment
and I asked them to bring it down and I ran down the back stairs, two
flights down, and I arrived in the emergency room just after or right behind
him being wheeled in, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time did you arrive at the emergency room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Oh, this was around 12:30&ndash;12:35 to 12:40. I shouldn't be
indefinite about this&mdash;in our own specialty practice, we watch the clock closely,
and there are many things we have to keep up with, but I didn't get that time
exactly, I'll admit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present at the time of your arrival in the emergency
room, if anyone?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. The hallway was loaded with people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What medical personnel were in attendance?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Including Mrs. Kennedy, I recognized, and Secret Service men,
I didn't know whether to block the way or get out of it, as it turned out. Dr.
James Carrico and Dr. Dulany&mdash;Dick Dulany, I guess you have his name, and
several nurses were in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you identify the nurses?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, not really. I could identify them only having later looked
around and identified from my own record that I have, the names of all who
were there later. Now, whether they are the same ones when I first went
there, I don't know. I have all the names in my report, it seemed to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you now identify all of the nurses from your later observations
of them?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, I can identify who was in there at the close of the
procedure, that is, the doctors, as well as those who were helping.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine, would you do that for us, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. These included a Mrs. or Miss Patricia Hutton and Miss
Diana Bowron, B-o-w-r-o-n (spelling), and a Miss Henchliffe&mdash;I don't know her
first name, but I do know it is Henchliffe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Margaret?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Margaret&mdash;certainly. Those three&mdash;there were probably some
student nurses too, whom I didn't recognize. Shall I continue?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, please. Have you now covered all the people you recollect
as being in the room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, as I came into the room, I saw only the&mdash;actually&mdash;you
know, in the haste of the coming of the President, two doctors whom I
recognized, and there were other people and I have identified all I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the President's condition when
you arrived in the emergency room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, I was aware of what he was in an agonal state. This is
not a too unfamiliar state that we see in the Service, as much trauma as we
see, that is, he had the agonal respiratory gasp made up of jerking movements
of the mylohyoid group of muscles. These are referred to sometimes
as chin jerk, tracheal tug or agonal muscles of respiration. He had this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
characteristic of respiration. His eyes were opened and somewhat exophthalmic
and color was greatly suffused, cyanotic&mdash;a purplish cyanosis.</p>

<p>Still, we have patients in the state, as far as cyanosis and agonal type
respiration, who are resuscitatable. Of course, you don't stop at this time
and think, "Well, this is a hopeless circumstance,"&mdash;because one in this state
can often be resusciated&mdash;this represents the activities prior to one's demise sometimes,
and if it can be stopped, such as the patient is oxygenated again and circulation
reinstituted, he can be saved.</p>

<p>Dr. Carrico had just introduced an endotracheal tube, I'm very proud of
him for this because it's not as easy as it sounds. At times and under the
circumstances&mdash;it was harder&mdash;he had just completed a 3-month rotation on the
anesthesiology service, and I thought this represented good background training
for a smart individual, and he told me he had a cuff on the endotracheal tube
and he introduced it below the wound.</p>

<p>The reason I said this, of course, this is a reflex&mdash;there is a tube, the endotracheal
tube, if it is pushed down a little too far it can go into the right main
stem of the bronchus impairing respiration from both lungs, or both chests.</p>

<p>There was in the room an intermittent positive pressure breathing apparatus,
which can be used to respire for a patient. As I connected this up, however,
Dr. Carrico and I connected it up to give oxygen by artificial respiration, Dr.
Giesecke and Dr. Hunt arrived on the scene with the anesthesia machine and I
connected it up instead with something I am more familiar with&mdash;not for anesthesia,
I must insist on that&mdash;it was for the oxygenation, the ability to control
ventilation with 100 percent oxygen.</p>

<p>As I came in there, other people came in also. This is my recollection. Now,
by this time I was in familiar surroundings, despite the anguish of the
circumstance.</p>

<p>Despite the unusual circumstance, in terms of the distinguished personage
who was the patient, I think the people who had gathered or who had congregated
were so accustomed to doing resuscitative procedures of this nature that they
knew where to fit into the resuscitation team without having a preconceived or
predirected plan, because, as obviously&mdash;some people were doing things not necessarily
in their specialty, but there was the opening and there was the necessity
for this being done.</p>

<p>There were three others who came in as I did who recognized at once the
neck wound, in fact, where the wound was, would indicate that we would have
serious pulmonary problems unless a tracheotomy tube was put in. This is
one way of avoiding pushing air out through a fractured trachea and down
into each chest cavity, which would cause a pneumothorax or a collapse of the
lungs. These were doctors Malcolm Perry, Charley Baxter, and Robert McClelland,
who with Dr. Carrico's help, I believe, started the tracheotomy.</p>

<p>About this time Drs. Kemp Clark and Paul Peters came in, and Dr. Peters
because of the appearance of the right chest, the obvious physical characteristics
of a pneumothorax, put in a closed chest drainage&mdash;chest tube. Because I felt
no peripheral pulse and was not aware of any pulse, I reported this to Dr. Clark
and he started closed chest cardiac massage.</p>

<p>There were other people&mdash;one which started an I.V. in a cutdown in the right
leg and one a cutdown in the left arm. Two of my department connected up the
cardioscope, in which we had electrical silence on the cardioscope as Dr. Clark
started closed chest massage. That's the sequence of events as I reconstructed
them that day and dictated them on my report, which you have here, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Speaking of your report, Dr. Jenkins, permit me to show you a
group of papers heretofore identified as Commission Exhibit No. 392 which
has also been identified by Mr. Price, the hospital Administrator, as being
photostatic copies of original reports in his possession and controlled as Custodian
of Records, and I show you what purports to be a report from you to
Mr. Price, dated November 22, 1963, and ask you if in fact this 2-page report was
submitted by you to Mr. Price?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, going back to the wound which you observed in the neck,
did you see that wound before the tracheotomy was performed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes; I did, because I was just connecting up the endotracheal
tube to the machine at the time and that's when Dr. Carrico said there was a
wound in the neck and I looked at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe that wound as specifically as you can?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, I'm afraid my description of it would not be as accurate,
of course, as that of the surgeons who were doing the tracheotomy, because my
look was a quick look before connecting up the endotracheal tube to the apparatus
to help in ventilation and respiration for the patient, and I was aware later
in the day, as I should have put it in the report, that I thought this was a
wound of exit because it was not a clean wound, and by "clean" clearly
demarcated, round, punctate wound which is the usual wound of an entrance
wound, made by a missile and at some speed. Of course, entrance wounds with
a lobbing type missile, can make a jagged wound also, but I was of the impression
and I recognized I had the impression it was an exit wound. However,
my mental appreciation for a wound&mdash;for the wound in the neck, I believe, was
sort of&mdash;was overshadowed by recognition of the wound in the scalp and skull
plate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described the wound in the neck as specifically as
you can at this moment?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you now describe the wound which you observed in the
head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Almost by the time I was&mdash;had the time to pay more attention
to the wound in the head, all of these other activities were under way. I was
busy connecting up an apparatus to respire for the patient, exerting manual
pressure on the breathing bag or anesthesia apparatus, trying to feel for a pulse
in the neck, and then reaching up and feeling for one in the temporal area, seeing
about connecting the cardioscope or directing its being connected, and then
turned attention to the wound in the head.</p>

<p>Now, Dr. Clark had begun closed chest cardiac massage at this time and I
was aware of the magnitude of the wound, because with each compression of the
chest, there was a great rush of blood from the skull wound. Part of the brain
was herniated; I really think part of the cerebellum, as I recognized it, was
herniated from the wound; there was part of the brain tissue, broken fragments
of the brain tissue on the drapes of the cart on which the President lay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any wounds immediately below the massive loss
of skull which you have described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. On the right side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. No&mdash;I don't know whether this is right or not, but I thought
there was a wound on the left temporal area, right in the hairline and right above
the zygomatic process.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The autopsy report discloses no such development, Dr. Jenkins.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, I was feeling for&mdash;I was palpating here for a pulse to see
whether the closed chest cardiac massage was effective or not and this probably
was some blood that had come from the other point and so I thought there was a
wound there also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time was President Kennedy pronounced
dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, this was pronounced, we know the exact time as 1300, according
to my watch, at least, at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, in your opinion, was the cause of death?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Cerebral injury&mdash;brain injury.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was President Kennedy ever turned over during the course of
this treatment at Parkland?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why was he not turned over, Dr. Jenkins?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Oh, I think this was beyond our prerogative completely. I think
as we pronounced the President dead, those in attendance who were there just
sort of melted away, well, I guess "melted" is the wrong word, but we felt like
we were intruders and left. I'm sure that this was considerably beyond our
prerogative, and the facts were we knew he had a fatal wound, and I think my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
own personal feeling was that this was&mdash;would have been meddlesome on anybody's
part after death to have done any further search.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was any examination of his back made before death, to your
knowledge?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. No, no; I'm sure there wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he remain on the stretcher cart at all times while he was
being cared for?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Can I say something that isn't in the report here, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; let's go off the record a minute.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr.
Jenkins.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that we are back on the record and Dr.
Jenkins has made an interesting observation about the time of the declaration
of death, and I will ask you, Dr. Jenkins, for you to repeat for the record what
you have just said off the record.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. As the resuscitative maneuvers were begun, such as "chest cardiac
massage," there was with each compression of the sternum, a gush of blood
from the skull wound, which indicated there was massive vascular damage in
the skull and the brain, as well as brain tissue damage, and we recognized by
this time that the patient was beyond the point of resuscitation, that he was in
fact dead, and this was substantiated by getting a silent electrical pattern on the
electrocardiogram, the cardioscope that was connected up.</p>

<p>However, for a period of minutes, but I can't now define exactly, since I didn't
put this in a report, after we knew he was dead, we continued attempted resuscitative
maneuvers.</p>

<p>When we saw the two priests who arrived in the corridor outside the emergency
room where this was taking place, I went to the door and asked one of those&mdash;after
turning over my ventilation, my respiration job to another one of my department&mdash;and
asked him what is the proper time to declare one dead. That is,
I am not a Catholic and I was not sure of the time for the last rites. As I remember
now, he said, "The time that the soul leaves the body&mdash;is not at exactly the
time that medical testimony might say that death was declared." There would
be a period of time and so if we wished to declare him dead at that time they
would still have the final rites.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they then have the final rites after the time he was declared
dead medically?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, just a minute now&mdash;I suspect that was hazy to me that
day&mdash;I'm not sure, it's still hazy. This was a very personal&mdash;on the part of the
very anguished occasion, and Mrs. Kennedy had come back into the room and
most of the people were beginning to leave because they felt like this was such
a grief stricken and private affair that they should not be there. It was real
intrusion even after they put forth such efforts at resuscitation and I'm not sure
now whether the priests came in while I was still doing the resuscitative procedure,
respiration at least, and while Dr. Clark was still doing the other. My
memory is that we had stopped. I was still present, however, and that's the
reason I'm not clear, because I hadn't left the room and I was still there as
the rites were performed and a prayer was said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Jenkins, would your observation of the wound and your
characterization of it as an exit hole be consistent with a set of facts which I
will ask you to assume for purposes of giving me your view or opinion.</p>

<p>Assume, first of all, if you will, that President Kennedy had a wound on the
upper right posterior thorax just above the upper border of the scapula, measuring
14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion process and 14 cm. below the
tip of the right mastoid process, and that the missile was a 6.5 mm. jacketed
bullet fired from a weapon having a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000
feet per second and approximately 160 to 250 feet from the President, and that
after entering the President's body at the point indicated, the missile traveled
between two strap muscles and through a fascia plane without violating the
pleura cavity, and then struck the right side of the trachea and exited through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
the throat, would the throat wound which you observed be consistent with
such a wound inflicted in the manner I have just described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. As far as I know, it wouldn't be inconsistent with it, Mr.
Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What has your experience been with gunshot wounds, that is,
to what extent have you had experience with such wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, having been Chief of the Anesthesia Service here for this
16 years, we have a rather large trauma emergency service, and so I see gunshot
wounds many times a week. I'm afraid I couldn't hazard a guess at the moment
as to how many we see a year, and I'm afraid probably if I knew, I would not
like to admit to this number, but I do go further in saying that my main interest
is not in the tracks of the wounds. My main interest is what physiological
changes that they have caused to the patient that I am to anesthetize or a
member of the department is to anesthetize, what has happened to the cardiovascular
system, respiratory, and neurological, and so I am aware of the wounds
of entrance and exit only by a peripheral part of my knowledge and activities
during the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever had any formal training in ballistics or in exit
wounds or entrance wounds&mdash;bullet wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. No, I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to any representative of the Federal Government
at any time prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Oh, there was a man whose name I don't remember now, who
showed what looked like the proper credentials from the FBI, who came to
ask only whether the report I had submitted to Mr. Price for the hospital record
or for Mr. Price's record constituted all the reports I had. That's the only
time, and that was the extent of our conversation, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that the only written record you have of your participation
in the treatment of the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Oh, I submitted one to the Dean of the Medical School, essentially
the same, and a very little more. I don't think you have that. I don't
know whether you want it or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, I would like to see it.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. It is essentially the same report&mdash;however&mdash;can I ask you something
off of the record here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Jenkins, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The record will show that we have been off the record on a
couple of matters which I am going to now put on the record, but I will ask
the court reporter to identify this as Dr. Jenkins' Exhibit No. 36.</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the Reporter as Dr. Jenkins' Exhibit No.
36, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I will ask you, Dr. Jenkins, for the record to identify this as a
report which you submitted to Dean Gill.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is this in conjunction with the report you submitted to Mr.
Price&mdash;do these reports constitute all the writings you have on your participation
in the treatment of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. One of the comments we were just discussing off the record&mdash;I
would like to put on the record, Dr. Jenkins, is the question as to whether or not
the wound in the neck would have been fatal in your opinion, absent the head
wound. What would your view of that be?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Well, from my knowledge of the wound in the neck, this would
not have been fatal, except for one thing, and that is&mdash;you have not told me
whether the wound with its point of entrance and point of exit had contacted
the vertebral column in its course?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It did not.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. In that case I would not expect this wound to have been fatal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your view, Dr. Jenkins, as to whether the wounds which
you observed were caused by one or two bullets?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. I felt quite sure at the time that there must have been two
bullets&mdash;two missiles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, Dr. Jenkins, what was your reason for that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Because the wound with the exploded area of the scalp, as I
interpreted it being exploded, I would interpret it being a wound of exit, and
the appearance of the wound in the neck, and I also thought it was a wound of
exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever changed any of your original opinions in connection
with the wounds received by President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. I guess so. The first day I had thought because of his pneumothorax,
that his wound must have gone&mdash;that the one bullet must have traversed
his pleura, must have gotten into his lung cavity, his chest cavity, I mean, and
from what you say now, I know it did not go that way. I thought it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from that opinion, now, have any of your other opinions
about the nature of his wounds or the sources of the wounds been changed in
any way?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. No; one other. I asked you a little bit ago if there was a
wound in the left temporal area, right above the zygomatic bone in the hairline,
because there was blood there and I thought there might have been a wound
there (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the left temporal area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes; the left temporal, which could have been a point of entrance
and exit here (indicating), but you have answered that for me. This was my
only other question about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, that those two points are the only ones on which your
opinions have been changed since the views you originally formulated?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes, I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the President's injuries?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes, I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is the conversation you had with that Secret Service Agent the
only time you were interviewed by anyone from the Federal Government prior
to today about this subject?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. As far as I remember&mdash;I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you say that was the only time you were interviewed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes, as far as I remember&mdash;I have had no formal interviews.
I have been asked&mdash;there have been some people calling on the phone. As you
know, there were many calls from various sources all over the country after
that, wanting to know whether we had done this method of treatment or some
other method and what principles we followed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But the only one you can identify as being from the Federal
Government is the one you have already related from the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you and I have a very brief conversation before the
deposition started today, when you gave me some of your views which you expounded
and expanded upon during the course of the deposition on the record?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is there anything which you think of to add that you believe
would be of some assistance or any assistance to the President's Commission in
its inquiry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. I believe not, Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, thank you very much, Dr. Jenkins.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>. All right.</p>

<h2 id="t51"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_RONALD_COY_JONES" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_RONALD_COY_JONES">TESTIMONY OF DR. RONALD COY JONES</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Ronald Coy Jones was taken at 10:20 a.m., on March 24,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show at this point that Dr. Ronald Jones has
arrived in response to a letter of request to give his deposition for the President's
Commission on the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Dr. Jones, the purpose of the President's Commission is to investigate all
the facts relating to the shooting and subsequent medical treatment of President
Kennedy and we have asked you to appear to testify concerning your
knowledge of that treatment.</p>

<p>With that statement of purpose, will you stand up and raise your right
hand. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before the President's
Commission during the course of this deposition proceeding will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Ronald Coy Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. General Surgery&mdash;resident physician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed by the State of Texas to practice medicine?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline briefly your educational background?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I graduated&mdash;I went to undergraduate school at the University of
Arkansas from 1950 to 1953, in pre-med. From 1953 through 1957, I went to
medical school and graduated from the University of Tennessee in Memphis, and
in 1957 through 1958 I took an internship in Los Angeles County General
Hospital.</p>

<p>From there I went to the University of Oklahoma and took a 2-year general
practice residency, 1 year, the first year, entailing a year of internal medicine
and its subspecialties, and a second year of surgery and its subspecialties,
which was approved by the American Board of Surgeons for 1 year of surgical
training, and from 1960 until the present time I have taken an additional 4
years of general surgery at Parkland, and have served as Chief Resident of
Surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to aid in the medical treatment of
President Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your
being called into the case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I was eating lunch with Dr. Perry and I heard the operator page Dr.
Tom Shires of the staff on two occasions, and the second time I answered the
phone and the operator told me that the President had been shot and was being
brought to the emergency room.</p>

<p>I turned around and immediately notified Miss Audrey Bell, who is the
operating room supervisor so that any arrangements could be made for immediate
surgery, and Dr. M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins, who is the Chief of the Anesthesiology
Department. From there I went across the room and notified Dr. Perry of the
shooting and we both went together to the emergency room, and it was at
that time we arrived shortly after the President had been brought in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your best estimate as to the time you arrived at the
emergency room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It was, I would say, around 23 or 25 minutes until 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was present, if anyone, at the time you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Dr. James Carrico, and possibly Dr. Richard Dulany, and I'm
not sure that he was there or was there for just a few minutes after we arrived.
I do recall seeing him there as one of the first ones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was any nurse present at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The head nurse in the emergency room was present <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know her name?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. It's left my mind right now&mdash;I know her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could that be Miss Henchliffe?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. She was there, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Bowron?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No&mdash;just <span class="locked">the&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Nelson?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Nelson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was anyone else present then, other than those whom you have
already mentioned at the time you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. There were three nurses there&mdash;Mrs. Nelson, Miss Henchliffe and
Miss Bowron.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were any other doctors present when you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Dr. Carrico was the only doctor other than possibly Dr. Dulany,
and I do know Dr. Carrico was there when I arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Dr. Don Curtis there when you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who arrived with you, if you recall?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Dr. Perry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you observe the President's condition to be upon
your arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. He appeared to be terminal, if not already expired, and Dr. Carrico
said that he had seen some attempted respirations, agonal respirations,
and with that history, we went ahead with emergency measures to try to restore
the airway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "attempted agonal respiration," do you mean an
effort by the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or, an effort by someone else to induce respiration?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, these apparently were as Dr. Carrico saw the President was
attempting to respire on his own, however, I did not personally see this in the
brief seconds that I stood there before I went ahead and started work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the lay definition for agonal respiration?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. These are the respirations that are somewhat of a strain, that
is, seen in a patient who is expiring&mdash;just very short, irregular type respirations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you continue now to describe what you observed to be
the President's condition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. We felt that he was in extreme shock, merely by the fact that
there was no motion, that he was somewhat cyanotic, his eyes were&mdash;appeared
to be fixed; there was no evidence of motion of the eyes; and we noticed that
he did not have a satisfactory airway or was not breathing on his own in a
satisfactory way to sustain life so that we felt that either an endotracheal
tube had to be instituted immediately, which was done by Dr. Carrico. We felt
that this was not adequate and since tracheotomy equipment was in the room,
we felt that he would profit more by tracheotomy and that we could be certain
that he was getting adequate oxygen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done with respect to applying oxygen to the President
then?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Well, a tracheotomy was done, and then an adapter was fitted
to this tube, and we had an anesthesia machine there by this time with Dr.
Jenkins available so that he could give him straight oxygen from the machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe anything else with respect to the President's
condition at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. You mean as far as wounds&mdash;that he had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. As we saw him the first time, we noticed that he had a small
wound at the midline of the neck, just above the suprasternal notch, and this
was probably no greater than a quarter of an inch in greatest diameter, and
that he had a large wound in the right posterior side of the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "we noticed," whom do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Well, Dr. Perry and I were the two that were there at this time
observing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Dr. Perry make any comment about the nature of the wound
at that time? Either wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe as precisely as you can the nature of the
head wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. There was large defect in the back side of the head as the President
lay on the cart with what appeared to be some brain hanging out of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
wound with multiple pieces of skull noted next with the brain and with a
tremendous amount of clot and blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe as precisely as you can the wound that you
observed in the throat?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The wound in the throat was probably no larger than a quarter of
an inch in diameter. There appeared to be no powder burn present, although
this could have been masked by the amount of blood that was on the head and
neck, although there was no obvious amount of powder present. There appeared
to be a very minimal amount of disruption of interruption of the surrounding
skin. There appeared to be relatively smooth edges around the wound,
and if this occurred as a result of a missile, you would have probably thought
it was a missile of very low velocity and probably could have been compatible
with a bone fragment of either&mdash;probably exiting from the neck, but it was a
very small, smooth wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any lump in the throat area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any blood on the throat area in the vicinity of the
wound which you have described of the throat?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Not a great deal of blood, as if in relation to the amount that was
around the head&mdash;not too much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What further action was taken by the medical team in addition
to that which you have described on the tracheotomy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Well, as Dr. Perry started the tracheotomy, I started the cut
down in the left arm to insert a large polyethylene catheter, to give an I.V. so
that we could give I.V. solutions as well as blood, and at the same time another
doctor or two were doing some cutdowns in the lower extremities around the
ankle. We made the cutdown in the left arm in the cephalic vein very rapidly
and I.V. fluids were started immediately and as I was doing this, Dr. Perry
was performing the tracheotomy, and it was about this time that Dr. Baxter
came in and went ahead to assist Dr. Perry with the tracheotomy, and as they
made a deeper incision in the neck to isolate the trachea, they thought they
saw some gush of air and the possibility of a pneumothorax on one side or the
other was entertained, and since I was to the left of the President, I went
ahead and put in the anterior chest tube in the second intercostal space.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that tube fully inserted, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I felt that the tube was fully inserted, and this was immediately
connected to underwater drainage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by "connected to underwater drainage",
Dr. Jones?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The tube is connected to a bottle whereby it aerates in the chest
from a pneumothorax and as the patient breathes, the air is forced out under
the water and produces somewhat of a suction so that the lung will reexpand
and will not stay collapsed and this will give adequate aeration to the body,
and we decided to go ahead and put in a chest tube on the opposite side; since
I could not reach the opposite side due to the number of people that were working
on the President. Dr. Baxter was over there helping Dr. Perry on that
side, as well as Dr. Paul Peters, the assistant head of urology here, and the
three of us then inserted the chest tube on the right side, primarily done by
Dr. Baxter and Dr. Peters on the right side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then what other treatment, if any, was afforded President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. After the tracheotomy was done, the intravenous fluid, blood
was started&mdash;I believe that the President was also administered some hydrocortisone
because of his history of adrenal insufficiency, and at this time
an electrocardiogram had been connected and it showed no evidence of a heartbeat.
Closed cardiac massage was then first begun by Dr. Perry and then I
believe that after about 5 minutes no significant or no myocardial activity was
present and he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What history did you refer to of President Kennedy's adrenal
insufficiency?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. As I recall, there had been in news that the President had several
years ago been on some type of steroid therapy and that he possibly had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Addison's disease. We had no documented evidence that he did or did not,
but caution was taken nonetheless in case his insufficiency was of severe
enough nature, because at the time of severe trauma a patient with adrenal
insufficiency often goes into a rapid degree of adrenal insufficiency and can
expire from lack of steroids being produced from the adrenal gland in such
a stressed situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you obtain that history from Mrs. Kennedy, or any other
person on the scene?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You just relied upon what had been occurring in the news?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would that reaction cause, if anything, if the President
had no adrenal insufficiency?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. This would not cause severe effects on any organ at all if the
adrenal gland were producing enough steroids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did any other doctors arrive during the time this treatment
was going on, other than those whom you have already mentioned?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Several doctors did subsequently appear in the room&mdash;Dr. McClelland
appeared shortly after Dr. Baxter, within a matter of just a very few
minutes, as well as Dr. Kemp Clark, who is head of neurosurgery here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any other doctors?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Dr. Jenkins was there and I think these are primarily the ones
that actually had any part, as far as taking care of the President, although
there were some other doctors in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Jones, I now hand you a report which purports to bear
your signature, labeled "Summary of treatment of the President," dated November
23, 1963, which I shall now ask the Court Reporter to mark as Dr. Jones'
Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>(Instrument mentioned marked by the Reporter as Dr. Jones' Exhibit No. 1,
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I ask you if this in fact is your signature?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I ask you if this was the report which you submitted concerning
your participation of the treatment of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In this report, Dr. Jones, you state the following, "Previously
described severe skull and brain injury was noted as well as a small hole in
anterior midline of the neck thought to be a bullet entrance wound." What
led you to the thought that it was a bullet entrance wound, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. The hole was very small and relatively clean cut, as you would
see in a bullet that is entering rather than exiting from a patient. If this
were an exit wound, you would think that it exited at a very low velocity to
produce no more damage than this had done, and if this were a missile of high
velocity, you would expect more of an explosive type of exit wound, with more
tissue destruction than this appeared to have on superficial examination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would it be consistent, then, with an exit wound, but of low
velocity, as you put it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes; of very low velocity to the point that you might think that
this bullet barely made it through the soft tissues and just enough to drop out
of the skin on the opposite side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your experience, Doctor, if any, in the treatment of
bullet wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. During our residency here we have approximately 1 complete
year out of the 4 years on the trauma service here, and this is in addition to
the 2 months that we spend every other day and every other night in the
emergency room during our first year, so that we see a tremendous number of
bullet wounds here in that length of time, sometimes as many as four and five
a night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever had any formal training in bullet wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever had occasion to observe a bullet wound which
was inflicted by a missile at approximate size of a 6.5 mm. bullet which passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
through the body of a person and exited from a neck without striking anything
but soft tissue from the back through the neck, where the missile came
from a weapon of the muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second, and the victim
was in the vicinity of 160 to 250 feet from the weapon?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No; I have not seen a missile of this velocity exit in the anterior
portion of the neck. I have seen it in other places of the body, but not in the
neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What other places in the body have you seen it, Dr. Jones?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I have seen it in the extremity and here it produces a massive
amount of soft tissue destruction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that in the situation of struck bone or not struck bone or
what?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Probably where it has struck bone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In a situation where it strikes bone, however, the bone becomes
so to speak a secondary missile, does it not, in accentuating the soft tissue
damage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Jones, did you have any speculative thought as to accounting
for the point of wounds which you observed on the President, as you thought
about it when you were treating the President that day, or shortly thereafter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. With no history as to the number of times that the President
had been shot or knowing the direction from which he had been shot, and
seeing the wound in the midline of the neck, and what appeared to be an exit
wound in the posterior portion of the skull, the only speculation that I could
have as far as to how this could occur with a single wound would be that it
would enter the anterior neck and possibly strike a vertebral body and then
change its course and exit in the region of the posterior portion of the head.
However, this was&mdash;there was some doubt that a missile that appeared to be
of this high velocity would suddenly change its course by striking, but at the
present&mdash;at that time, if I accounted for it on the basis of one shot, that would
have been the way I accounted for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would that account take into consideration the extensive
damage done to the top of the President's head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. If this were the course of the missile, it probably&mdash;possibly could
have accounted for it, although I would possibly expect it to do a tremendous
amount of damage to the vertebral column that it hit and if this were a high
velocity missile would also think that the entrance wound would probably
be larger than the one that was present at the time we saw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe whether or not there was any damage to the
vertebral column?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, we could not see this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you discuss this theory with any other doctor or doctors?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes; this was discussed after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. With Dr. Perry&mdash;is the only one that I recall specifically, and
that was merely as to how many times the President was shot, because even
immediately after death, within a matter of 30 minutes, the possibility of a
second gunshot wound was entertained and that possibly he had been shot
more than once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any wound on the President's back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the President ever turned over?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Not while I was in the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was he on when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. He was on an emergency room cart, which is on wheels and can
be changed to varying heights and also varying positions, as far as elevating the
head or elevating the feet, lowering the head and so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he ever taken off that cart from the time he was brought
into the emergency room to the time he was pronounced to be dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor, are you working toward board certification at this
time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your status on your progress with that, generally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I will finish my formal training in surgery in July of this year,
which will complete 5 years of general surgery residency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old are you at the present time, Dr. Jones?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Thirty-one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you discussed this matter with any representatives of
the Federal Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, I believe the Secret Service has been here on at least two
occasions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did they ask you on those occasions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. I think, primarily, to verify that what I had written was true
and that I had been one of the first doctors to be in the room with the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they ask you anything else other than that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. On one occasion they asked if there were any other pieces of paper
that had been written on as to the care that had been administered to the
President that I had not turned in, and I told them "No."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you and I sit down and talk for a few minutes before
we went on the record in this deposition, with me indicating to you the general
purpose and the line of questioning, and you setting forth the same information
which we have put on the record here today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be helpful
to the Commission in any way?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That concludes the deposition. Thank you very much, Dr.
Jones.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Jones</span>. All right.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t57"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_DON_TEEL_CURTIS" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_DON_TEEL_CURTIS">TESTIMONY OF DR. DON TEEL CURTIS</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Don Teel Curtis was taken at 9:25 a.m., on March 24,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that present are Dr. Don Curtis and the
court reporter, in connection with the deposition proceeding being conducted
by the President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy,
which is inquiring into all facets of the assassination, including the medical
treatment performed for President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Dr. Don Curtis is appearing here this morning in response to a letter requesting
him to testify concerning his knowledge of that medical treatment of
President Kennedy. With that preliminary statement of the general objective
of the Commission and the specific objective of this deposition proceeding,
Dr. Curtis, will you rise and raise your right hand, please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give before this Presidential Commission
in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Dr. Don Teel, T-e-e-l (spelling) Curtis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your occupation or profession?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Oral surgeon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly your educational background?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I attended my freshman year at Boulder, Colo., Colorado University,
2 subsequent years of undergraduate work at Texas University, 4 years
at Baylor Dental College, and I have been interning here for a year and a half.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What year did you graduate from Baylor Dental College?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your age at the present time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Twenty-six.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what has your work consisted of here at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I have functioned as an intern in oral surgery and also now am
a resident this year in oral surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you a licensed dentist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did you obtain that status in the State of Texas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I think in August of 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to assist in the medical treatment of
President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly the circumstances surrounding your
call or your joining in the participation in that medical effort?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I was&mdash;do you want me to tell from the time that I got to the
emergency room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes&mdash;how did you happen to get to the emergency room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I was in our out-patient clinic and saw the President's car, or
I saw that it had arrived at the emergency room entrance, and I went over
there as a matter of curiosity and was directed into the emergency room and
there was directed by a policeman into the room where President Kennedy was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I don't know&mdash;it was shortly after he arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how long after he arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I would say it was within&mdash;I would say within a minute after
he arrived at the trauma room, although there's no way for me to know that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present in the trauma room at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Dr. Carrico and a nurse, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know the identity of the nurse?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe, if anything, as to the condition of President
Kennedy at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I observed that he was in a supine position, with his head extended,
and I couldn't see on my arrival&mdash;I couldn't see the nature of the
wounds, however, Dr. Carrico was standing at the patient's head. Dr. Carrico
had just placed an endotracheal tube and I participated in applying the Bird
machine respirator into the endotracheal tube for artificial respiration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How does it happen that you would participate to that effect
in view of the fact that you are an oral surgeon?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. We participate in the emergency room on traumatic injuries of
both the face and the entire patient, because the face is hooked onto a patient.
We have a tour through anesthesia. We spend time on general anesthesia
where we learn management of the patient's airway which makes us, I would
say, qualified, for airway management. In our training here at the hospital
we many, many times have patients on intravenous infusion and so we are well
acquainted with the procedures attendant with the management of I.V. fluids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there always someone from oral surgery available at the
trauma area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. One of the oral surgeons is on call at the emergency room at all
times and we try to stay within a very short distance from the emergency
room. We see many patients in the emergency room area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that for the purpose of rendering aid for someone who would
be injured in a way which would call for an oral surgeon?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes&mdash;maxillofacial injuries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And in addition, you help out in a general way when there is an
emergency situation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, was there anything in President Kennedy's condition which
called for the application of your specific specialty?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No; there wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, you aided in a general way in the treatment of him as an
emergency case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you continue to tell me what you have observed
with respect to his condition when you first saw him, including what you noted,
if anything, with respect to his respiration.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. It is very difficult to say whether or not the President was making
a respiratory effort, but I'm not sure that he wasn't making a respiratory effort.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think that he was making a respiratory effort?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. He could have been, and that's as far as I can go on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe movements of the chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I thought I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was his coloring?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. He was pink&mdash;he wasn't cyanotic when I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And will you explain in lay terms what cyanotic means for
the record at this point?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. When the hemoglobin of the blood is reduced, it turns a blue color
and the patient becomes blue, when a certain percentage of the hemoglobin is
reduced. That's not a lay term either, but when the patient is in oxygen need
or oxygen want, cyanosis would be apparent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how does that manifest itself in the patient?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. The patient will be a blue, gray, ashen color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action was Dr. Carrico taking upon your arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. He had placed an endotracheal tube in the President's trachea for
artificial respiration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he doing anything else?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes; he was applying the Bird machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe what other steps he was taking, if any?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. He directed that a tracheotomy setup be brought to the emergency
room, and I think it was Dr. Carrico directed me to start the I.V. fluids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, if anything, did you do in response to his direction?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I assisted him in fitting the tube from the Bird machine to the
endotracheal tube and I assisted in removing some of the President's clothes
and did the cutdown on his leg.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, specifically, did you do pursuant to the cutdown on
his leg?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. A small incision was made on the ankle and a vein is bluntly
dissected free, small holes placed in the vein and a venous catheter is placed
in this vein and a purse string ligature is then tied around the catheter at one
end, and then the wound was closed with sutures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you do anything else to the President following that
operative procedure?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Then, the initial cutdown that I started was ineffective and infiltrated
into the tissues. I think possibly I cut the knot too close of the purse
string ligature, so I was getting ready to do another one and it was decided since
fluids were going in the other leg, it wouldn't be necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What other action did you take, if any, in the treatment of the
President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you remain in the trauma room No. 1?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I did until he was pronounced dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action was taken by anyone else in the trauma room
while you were there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. My attention was focused on what I was doing, so I wasn't
aware&mdash;I knew that a cutdown was being performed and that is about all I
could see. I mean, I knew that a tracheotomy was being performed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What other doctors were present there at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I know that Dr. Perry was there and I know Dr. Baxter was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
there, and then I recall Dr. Jenkins from the Anesthesia Department, and Dr.
Seldin, Dr. Crenshaw, and that's about all the doctors&mdash;I could think of others
probably, but I can't remember now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify any other nurses who were there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No; I can't&mdash;I wasn't paying attention to the nurses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. During the course of your presence near President Kennedy,
did you have any opportunity to observe any wounds on his body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. After I had completed the cutdown, I went around to the right
side of the patient and saw the head wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you observe there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Oh&mdash;fragments of bone and a gross injury to the cranial contents,
with copious amounts of hemorrhage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any other wound on the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No; I didn't. As I said before, I noticed the mass in the pre-tracheal
area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you say "as you said before," you mean in our
previous discussions prior to going on the record here?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And will you state now for the record what you did notice with
respect to the tracheal area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. The President's head was extended or hyperextended and I
noticed that in the suprasternal notch there was a mass that looked like a
hematoma to me, or a blood clot in the tissues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How big was that hematoma?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Oh, I think it was 5 cm. in size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What color was it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. It had no color&mdash;there was just skin overlying it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did it appear to be?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Probably a hematoma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any perforation or hole in the President's
throat?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No; I didn't. But that doesn't mean it wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have an opportunity to look closely for it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. I focused my attention on his neck for an instant, and that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear any discussion among any of the doctors about
an opening on his neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any written report concerning your activity
on the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you any notes or writings of any sort concerning your
work with the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to any representatives of the Federal Government
about your participation in treating President Kennedy before today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Prior to the time that we went on the record here with the
court reporter, did you and I have a very brief conversation concerning the
purpose of the deposition and the general questions which I would ask you on
the record?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is the information which you have provided on the record
the same as that which you gave me before the court reporter started taking
notes?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think would be helpful
to the Commission in its work?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. Curtis, for coming here today.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Curtis</span>. All right.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Fouad A. Bashour was taken at 1:15 p.m., on March 25,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Fouad Bashour has appeared pursuant
to a letter of request from the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy, in connection with the Commission's inquiry into
all of the factors surrounding the assassination of the President, including medical
treatment received at Parkland Hospital, and Dr. Bashour's knowledge, if
any, as related to the treatment in the emergency room.</p>

<p>With that preliminary statement of purpose, Dr. Bashour, would you mind
rising and then raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the President's
Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. F-o-u-a-d (spelling), Fouad A. Bashour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. I am an internist with a specialization in cardiology. I am associate
professor of medicine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed by the State of Texas to practice medicine
here?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you board certified at the present time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No, sir; I don't have my board because I am not yet a citizen.
I will be taking my citizenship this year, I hope, and then I will be able to sit
for the board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to assist in the treatment of President
Kennedy back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Yes; we were called from the dining room, the doctors' dining
room, and we went directly to the President Kennedy room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "we" whom do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Dr. Seldin and myself&mdash;we left the dining room and went right
straight down to the President's room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is Dr. Seldin's first name?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Donald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is his specialty, if any?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. He's chairman of the department of medicine and professor of
medicine. He is a specialist and a recognized famous specialist in renal diseases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, in lay language, does that facet of medicine involve?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Kidney diseases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Dr. Seldin accompany you into the emergency room where
President Kennedy was located?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. We went to the room together and then I was left alone because
this is a problem&mdash;a heart problem.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Dr. Seldin remain in the room with you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Well, he came and stayed for&mdash;he just left the room after we
came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did he stay in the room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. A few seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present in the room when you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. When I arrived, Dr. Kemp Clark was doing the cardiac massage
on the President, Dr. Jenkins was in charge of controlling artificial respiration
of the President, and the probably there were some three or four&mdash;I don't
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you observe the President's condition to be at the
time you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. The President was lying on the stretcher, the head wound was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
massive, the blood was dripping from the head, and at that time the President
had an endotracheal tube, and his pupils were dilated, his eyes were staring,
and they were not reactive, there was no pulsations, his heart sounds were not
present, and his extremities were cold.</p>

<p>Then, we attached the scope&mdash;the cardioscope and there was a flip, this was
probably artificial. Upon stopping the cardiac machine, there was no cardiac
activity. That means the heart was standing still. We continued cardiac
massage and still there was no cardiac activities, so the President was declared
dead shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time was he declared dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Well, according to my notes, we said here, "Declared dead
about 12:55," or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that a precise time fixed or was that just a general approximation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No, sir; approximation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you refer to the "flip" what do you mean by that, Dr.
Bashour?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. On the scope&mdash;some change in the baseline of the scope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did that indicate some activity in the President's heart?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No, sir; not necessarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else could have accounted for the flip besides that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Anything extraneous could have accounted for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, you require a number of flips before you inquire if there
is heart activity?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Well, it depends on the configuration of the flip&mdash;if the flip resembles
an electrocardiogram activity&mdash;it shows cardiac activity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that configuration of the flip like heart activity or not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. It wasn't, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is your field, is it not, you read those flips?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Well, it's my field to see the electrocardiograms; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, in your professional opinion, the flip which you saw was
not a conclusive indicator of heart activity?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. As a matter of fact, when he removed his hand, there was
nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who is "he"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Dr. Clark, who was doing the cardiac massage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else was done to the President, if anything, in addition
to those things you have already mentioned after you arrived on the scene?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Really, as far as I know, it was the end of the scene&mdash;nothing
was done afterward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any wound besides the head wound which you
have just described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No; I did not observe any wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the condition of the front part of the President's
neck upon your arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. The only thing&mdash;it was covered with the endotracheal tube&mdash;I
did not really pay attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have an opportunity to see the neck wound before the
tracheotomy was performed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No; I came after everything was done to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor, I show you a group of papers heretofore marked as
"Commission Exhibit No. 392," and I call your attention to the photostatic
copy of a sheet which purports to be a report made by you on November 22,
1963, at 4:45 p.m., is that your report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that in fact your signature?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the facts set forth therein the essence of what you
observed and what you know about this matter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to anyone from the Federal Government prior
to today about your treatment of President Kennedy?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. There was a security officer or something called me on the
phone one day and said did I write any note besides this note on the chart, and
I said "No." I don't know his name even.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What note was he referring to?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. This note here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He asked you if you wrote what?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Other notes than this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you had any other notes?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you have any other notes other than the one I have just
shown you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the Secret Service agent ask you anything else other than
that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you talk to any other representative of the Federal
Government on any occasion prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, did you and I talk for a few minutes about the type of
questions I would be asking you during this deposition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is the information which you have given me on the record
here and written down by the court reporter the same as you told me before
she arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, will you give me just an outline of your educational
background, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. I got my baccalaureate from French Government in 1941&mdash;first
part. I got my second part, baccalaureate in mathematics and science in 1942,
I got my B.A. degree in 1944 from the American University of Beirut, my M.D.
degree in 1949, and my Ph. D. in 1957 from the University of Minnesota. I
came back to this country in 1959 from the American University of Beirut,
as an instructor, and from 1959 to 1963 I jumped from instructor to assistant
professor to associate professor in February 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think will be helpful
in any way to the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Bashour</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for coming, Dr. Bashour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed to practice in Texas, to practice medicine?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any specialty?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Anesthesiology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you board-certified?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you working toward board-certification?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you outline briefly your educational background?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Premedical school at University of Texas in Austin, medical school,
Southwestern Medical School Branch of the University of Texas, internship,
Dallas Methodist Hospital, and anesthesiology residence at Parkland Memorial
Hospital, starting in July 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, in what year did you graduate from medical school?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how old are you at the present time, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Thirty-four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to render assistance to President John F.
Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state how you came to be called into the case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. I was notified while I was on duty in the operating suite of the
hospital that anesthesia assistance was needed in the emergency room. President
Kennedy supposedly had been shot and had been brought to the emergency
room, and I immediately went down the back elevator to the emergency room
to see if I could be of assistance, and when I walked in, a tracheotomy was
being performed. President Kennedy still had an endotracheal tube, an oro-tracheal
tube in place, and the connector from this to the Bird respirator was
removed. The anesthesia machine had been simultaneously rolled into the
room and Dr. Jenkins connected the anesthesia machine to the oro-tracheal
tube and it stayed there for a brief period, until the tracheotomy tube was
placed in the tracheotomy, at which time I connected the breathing tubes from
the anesthesia machine to the tracheotomy and held this in place while Dr.
Jenkins controlled the ventilation with 100-percent oxygen from the anesthesia
machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you assist Dr. Jenkins then in his work?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Only insofar as I held the endotracheal connector in place into the
tracheotomy tube.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors in addition to Dr. Jenkins then were present, if any,
at the time of your arrival?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. You mean everybody in the room? I don't know that I can name
all of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Name as many as you can, if you will, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. There was Dr. Jenkins, there was myself for a brief period, there
was Dr. Giesecke, Dr. Jackie Hunt&mdash;they left shortly after arriving. I heard
later that they had gone across the hall to Governor Connally's room to assist
him; Dr. Malcolm Perry, Dr. Charles Baxter, Dr. Kemp Clark, Dr. Bob McClelland,
Dr. James Carrico, Dr. Ron Jones, was there. I think, shortly after I
arrived, and Dr. Fouad Bashour came in from cardiology; Dr. Don Seldin
walked in briefly, I can't remember the team that worked on the cutdowns on
the legs&mdash;I can't remember that. This is sort of hazy, because it was a couple
of days later we went through the same business over again and I am liable to say
that there was somebody there that worked on Kennedy that actually had
worked on Oswald, because I was on the Oswald mess too. This is all that I
remember were positively there. I remember their being there, but there were
others that I am not sure of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the President's condition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. He looked moribund in my medical judgment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any wounds on him at the time you first saw
him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. There was a midline neck wound below the level of the cricoid
cartilage, about 1 to 1.5 cm. in diameter, the lower part of this had been cut
across when I saw the wound, it had been cut across with a knife in the performance
of the tracheotomy. The back of the right occipitalparietal portion
of his head was shattered, with brain substance extruding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Returning to the wound which you first described, can you
state in any more detail the appearance of it at the time you first saw it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. I don't think I could&mdash;this is about all I noticed. I noticed this
wound very briefly and it was a matter of academics as to how he sustained the
wound. My attention, because of my standing on the right side of the patient
who was lying supine, my attention was very soon directed to the head wound,
and this was my major concern.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And as to the neck wound, did you have occasion to observe
whether there was a smooth, jagged, or what was the nature of the portion of the
neck wound, which had not been cut by the tracheotomy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. It was slightly ragged around the edges.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you said <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. No powder burns; I didn't notice any powder burns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the dimension of the punctate wound, without regards
to the tracheotomy which was being started?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. It looked&mdash;it was as you said, it was a punctate wound. It was
roughly circular, about, I would judge, 1.5 cm. in diameter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you mean when you just made your reference to the
academic aspect with the wound, Dr. Akin?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Well, naturally, the thought flashed through my mind that this
might have been an entrance wound. I immediately thought it could also have
been an exit wound, depending upon the nature of the missile that made the
wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would be the circumstances on which it might be one or
the other?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Well, if the President had been shot with a low velocity missile,
such as fire from a pistol, it was more likely to have been an entrance wound,
is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. If, however, he had been shot with a high velocity military type
of rifle, for example, it could be either an entrance wound or an exit wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why do you say it could be either an entrance wound or an
exit wound with respect to the rifle?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Well, because a high velocity missile coming from a military rifle,
especially if the missile were a jacketed missile, a copper- or steel-jacketed missile,
itself, the missile itself is not distorted when it passes through soft tissue,
and the wound made when the bullet leaves the body, is a small wound, much
like the wound of entrance, but like I said, I didn't devote much time to conjecture
about this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How much experience have you had, if any, on gunshot wounds,
doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. I can't really give you, say, how many cases a week I see of this.
Most of my experience with this is in an anesthetic situation with patients coming
into the hospital, having sustained gunshot injuries, most of them are injured
with low velocity missiles, smaller caliber&mdash;.22 caliber to .38 caliber, and most
of them are not injured in a through and through fashion. In other words, I
don't see too many exit wounds, the bullets are slow moving, and they enter the
body and don't leave it. They usually stay in it, so consequently I could not
be considered an expert in exit wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the general line of bullet wounds which come into Parkland
Hospital, would you say?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. What I have just described, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Yes; I think so. Most of the people seem to be shot with cheap
ammunition fired out of inferior weapons.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would your experience with the type of bullet wounds you have
just described be about the same as the other doctors have here at Parkland,
or would there be some difference between what you have seen on bullet wounds
and what the other doctors have seen?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. I think so, except there is one difference&mdash;I am not ordinarily on
duty in the emergency room, so I am not very often the first doctor to see one
of these people injured in this fashion. When I see them they are people who
have sustained a gunshot injury, but who lived to make it to the operating
room. We, I'm sure, have a lot of people who are shot and who are dead on
arrival at the emergency room, and they are examined by the emergency room
physicians, and I never see them, so there would be a lot of people down there
that I never have seen. They might be injured with a hunting rifle or a good
quality ammunition, and I would not have seen them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Akin, permit me, if you will, to give you a set of facts
which I will ask you to assume for the purpose of giving me an opinion, if
you are able to formulate one. Assume that the President was struck by a
6.5 mm. missile which had a muzzle velocity of approximately 2,000 feet per
second at a time when the President was approximately 160 to 250 feet away
from the weapon. Assume further that the bullet entered the President's body in
the upper right posterior thorax just above the upper border of the scapula at a
point 14 cm. from the tip of the right acromion process and 14 cm. below the
tip of the right mastoid process. Assume further that the missile traveled
through or in between, rather, the strap muscles without penetrating either
muscle but going in between the two in the area of his back and traveled
through the fascial channel without violating the pleura cavity, and that the
bullet struck the side of the trachea and exited from the throat in the position
of the punctate wound which you have described you saw, would the wound
you saw be consistent with a wound of exit under the factors that I have just
outlined to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. As far as I know, it is perfectly compatible from what you have
described, except when you say it passed through without injuring the strap
muscles, are you talking about the anterior strap muscles of the neck or are
you talking about the posterior muscles of the neck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The anterior strap muscles of the neck.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. It's a matter of clarification because there are no strap muscles
posterior, by my terminology. Yes, this is perfectly consistent with what I
know about, or what I have been told by military experts, concerning high
velocity missile injuries.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the basis of your information from the military
experts you just referred to?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Military rifle demonstrations when I was a senior student at
Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio. We took a brief two day tour there
with demonstrations of high velocity missile injury.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to the head wound, Dr. Akin, did you observe
below the gaping wound which you have described any other bullet wound in
the back of the head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. No; I didn't. I could not see the back of the President's head
as such, and the right posterior neck was obscured by blood and skull fragments
and I didn't make any attempt to examine the neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any opportunity to observe the President's
clothes?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. I noticed them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With respect to examining the shirt, for example, to see what
light that would shed, if any, on the trajectory of the bullet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. No; I didn't. The front of the chest was uncovered, the pants
had been loosened and lowered below the iliac crest, and the only article of
clothing I noticed in particular was his back corset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe with respect to the back corset which
you just mentioned?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. It had been loosened and was just lying loose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe the corset, indicating how wide it was?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. The only portion I saw was the front portion of the corset and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
it was about, I'd say, 5 or 6 inches in width, and made out of some white heavy
fabric with the usual straps and buckles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any Ace bandage strapping the President's
buttocks area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that area of his anatomy visible to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Not his buttocks, he was lying supine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was President Kennedy ever turned over, to your knowledge?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Not while I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long were you there altogether, Dr. Akin?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Oh, probably 15, maybe 20&mdash;perhaps 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present when he was pronounced to be dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Yes&mdash;I didn't leave until Dr. Clark and Dr. Jenkins had mutually
agreed that nothing else could be done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time was he pronounced dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. 1300 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, in your opinion, was the cause of death?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Massive gunshot injury to the brain&mdash;primary cause.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have already described some of the treatment which
was performed on the President; could you supplement that by describing
what else was done for the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Other than the placement of chest tubes, artificial respiration,
brief external cardiac massage&mdash;I don't know. Anything else I said would
be hearsay, and I understand that he did receive some cortisone. He received
so much Ringer's lactate, but this is not of my own personal knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many bullets were involved in the wounds inflicted on
the President, Dr. Akin?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Probably two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever changed any of your original opinions in connection
with your observations of the President or any opinions you formed
in connection with what you saw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. You mean as to how he was injured?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, as to how he was injured.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Well, no; not really because I didn't have any opinions, necessarily.
Any speculation that I might have done about how he was injured
was just that, it was just speculation. I didn't form an opinion until it
was revealed where he was when he was injured and where the alleged assassin
was when he fired the shots, so I didn't have any opinions. It was my
immediate assumption that when I saw the extent of the head wound, I
assumed at that point that he had probably been hit in the head with a high
velocity missile because of the damage that had been done. The same thing
happened to his head and would happen to a sealed can of sauerkraut that you
hit with a high velocity missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any opinion as to the direction that the bullet
hit his head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. I assume that the right occipitalparietal region was the exit,
so to speak, that he had probably been hit on the other side of the head, or
at least tangentially in the back of the head, but I didn't have any hard and
fast opinions about that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been interviewed by any representative of the Federal
Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. You mean concerning this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Concerning this matter.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. I think I was probably interviewed by a member of the Secret
Service some weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you say to him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Virtually the same thing, as I recall&mdash;I didn't make as long a
statement, he just wanted to know where I was and what I did and I told
him briefly and that seemed to satisfy him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that the only time you have been interviewed by any
representative of the Federal Government concerning this matter prior to
today?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Yes; as far as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And before I started to take your deposition, did you and I
have a very brief discussion about the nature of the deposition and the questions
I would ask you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you give me about the same information, exactly the
same information you have put on the record here this morning?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. To my knowledge; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of
assistance to the President's Commission in their inquiry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. No; I don't think so. I don't know exactly if there is any disagreement
or discrepancy in the testimony from the various people who have
testified, so I don't know. This is all I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's fine. Thank you very much, Dr. Akin.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Akin</span>. That's all right, thank you.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t68"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_PAUL_CONRAD_PETERS" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_PAUL_CONRAD_PETERS">TESTIMONY OF DR. PAUL CONRAD PETERS</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Paul Conrad Peters was taken at 4 p.m., on March 24,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Paul Peters is present, having
responded to a request to have his deposition taken in connection with the investigation
of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy, which is investigating all aspects of the assassination, including the
medical treatment of President Kennedy at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and
for the latter sequence of events we have asked Dr. Peters to appear and testify
what he knows, if anything, concerning that medical attention.</p>

<p>With that statement of purpose in calling you, Dr. Peters, may I ask you to
rise and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the President's
Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Paul Conrad Peters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Doctor of medicine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And will you outline for me briefly your educational background?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I went to college at Indiana University in Bloomington, Ind., and
received an A.B. degree from Indiana University in 1950, and received an M.D.
degree from Indiana University in 1953. I took my internship at the Philadelphia
General Hospital, 1953 and 1954. I took my residency in Urological Surgery at
Indiana University from 1954 to 1957, and from 1957 to 1963 I was chief of
Urology at U.S.A.F. Hospital, Carswell, which is the largest hospital in SAC,
and I was regional consultant to the surgeon general in Urological surgery. Since
July 1963, I have been assistant professor of Urology at Southwestern Medical
School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you board certified, Dr. Peters?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I am certified by the American Board of Urology&mdash;1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to render medical services to President
John Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you outline briefly the circumstances relating to your
arriving on the scene where he was?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. As I just gave you a while ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I was in the adjacent portion of the hospital preparing material
for a lecture to the medical students and residents later in the day, when I
heard over the radio that the President had been shot and there was a great
deal of confusion at the time and the extent of his injuries was not immediately
broadcast over the radio, and I thought, because of the description of the location
of the tragedy he would probably be brought to Parkland for care, and so
I went to the emergency room to see if I could render assistance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at about what time did you arrive at the emergency room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, could I ask a question or two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. As I recall, he was shot about 12:35 our time; is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I believe that's been fixed most precisely at 12:30, Dr. Peters.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. So, I would estimate it was probably about 12:50 when I got
there, I really don't know for certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you find present, if anyone, when you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. When I arrived the following people I noted were present in the
room: Drs. Perry, Baxter, Ron Jones, and McClelland. The first thing I
noticed, of course, was that President Kennedy was on the stretcher and that
his feet were slightly elevated. He appeared to be placed in a position in which
we usually treat a patient who is in shock, and I noticed that Dr. Perry and Dr.
Baxter were present and that they were working on his throat. I also noticed
that Dr. Ron Jones was present in the room. I took off my coat and asked what
I could do to help, and then saw it was President Kennedy. I really didn't know
it was President Kennedy until that time. Dr. Perry was there and he and Dr.
Baxter were doing the tracheotomy and we asked for a set of tracheotomy tubes
to try and get one of the appropriate size. I then helped Dr. Baxter assemble the
tracheotomy tube which he inserted into the tracheotomy wound that he and Dr.
Perry had created.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any others present at that time, before you go on
as to what aid you rendered?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I believe Dr. <span class="locked">Carrico&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any other doctors present?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. And Dr. Jenkins was present.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now covered all of those who were present at that
time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. And Dr. Shaw walked into the room and left&mdash;for a moment&mdash;but
he didn't stay. He just sort of glanced at the President and went across
the hall. Mrs. Kennedy was in the corner with someone who identified himself
as the personal physician of the President&mdash;I don't remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Burkley?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I don't know his name. That's just who he said he was, because
he was asking that the President be given some steroids, which was done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He requested that.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. That's right, he said he should have some steroids because he was
an Addisonian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by that in lay language?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, Addison's disease is a disease of the adrenal cortex which
is characterized by a deficiency in the elaboration of certain hormones that
allow an individual to respond to stress and these hormones are necessary
for life, and if they cannot be replaced, the individual may succumb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And Dr. Burkley, or whoever was the President's personal
physician, made a request that you treat him as an Addisonian?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. That's right&mdash;he recommended that he be given steroids because
he was an Addisonian&mdash;that's what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any nurses present at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I don't remember a nurse being in the room all the time, but
they were coming in and out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you identified all the people who were present to the best
of your recollection?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Did I mention Dr. Robert McClelland, he was also there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Dr. Dulany there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I don't remember him, he may have been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who else was there, if anyone, that you can recall, or have you
now given me everyone you can recall?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, I am giving you my impression of the situation as I walked
in and those are the ones I remember right now. Dr. Kemp Clark also came
in during the maneuvering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, who else came in during the course of the operative
procedures?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. The anesthesiologists, Drs. Jenkins and Gene Akin, I believe, came
in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anyone else come in?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I am not certain of anyone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, tell us what aid was rendered to President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Dr. Perry and Dr. Baxter were doing the tracheotomy and a
set of tracheotomy tubes was obtained and the appropriate size was determined
and I gave it to Baxter, who helped Perry put it into the wound, and Perry
noted also that there appeared to be a bubbling sensation in the chest and
recommended that chest tubes be put in. Dr. Ron Jones put a chest tube in
on the left side and Dr. Baxter and I put it in on the right side&mdash;I made the incision
in the President's chest, and I noted that there was no bleeding from the
wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you put that chest tube all the way in on the right side?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. That's our presumption&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what else was done for the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. About the same time&mdash;there was a question of whether he really
had an adequate pulse, and so Dr. Ronald Jones and I pulled his pants down
and noticed that he was wearing his brace which had received a lot of publicity
in the lay press, and also that he had an elastic bandage wrapped around his
pelvis at&mdash;in a sort of a figure eight fashion, so as to encompass both thighs
and the lower trunk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose of that bandage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I presume that it was&mdash;my thoughts at the time were that he
probably had been having pelvic pain and had put this on as an additional
support to stabilize his lower pelvis. It seemed quite interesting to me that
the President of the United States had on an ordinary $3 Ace bandage probably
in an effort to stabilize his pelvis. I suppose he had been having some back
pain and that was my thought at the time, but we removed this bandage in an
effort to feel a femoral pulse. We were never certain that we got a good pulse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe in as much detail as you can the type of
brace he was wearing?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, it appeared similar to a corset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How thick was it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I would estimate it was one-eighth of an inch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. An eighth of an inch thick?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how high was it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, it completely encompassed his midsection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It encompassed his midsection?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. His circumference&mdash;yes&mdash;and it was probably, I would guess about
8 to 11 inches.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In width?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Running in his waist area at the top of his hips up to the lower
part of his chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I would estimate that it went from the lower part of his chest
to the pelvic girdle. About this time it was noted also that he had no effective
heart action, and Dr. Perry asked whether he should open the chest and
massage the heart. In the meantime, of course, the tracheotomy had been done
and completed and had been hooked on to apparatus for assisting his respiration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action, if any, was taken on the open-heart massage?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. It was pointed out that an examination of the brain had been
done. Dr. Jenkins had observed the brain and Dr. Clark had observed the brain
and it was pointed out to Dr. Perry that it appeared to be a mortal wound, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
involving the brain, and that open-heart massage would probably not add anything
to what had already been done, and that external cardiac massage is
known to be as efficient as direct massage of the heart itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any further treatment rendered to the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Yes, Dr. Perry began immediate external compression of the chest
in an effort to massage the heart, even before he asked the question as to
whether the thoracotomy should be done. As soon as there was a question as to
whether there was a pulse or not, he immediately began external chest
compression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What other action was taken to aid the President, if any?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, cut downs were done on the extremities, and tubes were
inserted in the veins, and I know on the right ankle anteriorly, and I believe
in the left arm and also in the left leg, in order to administer fluid and blood
which he did receive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described all of the medical attention given the
President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, I believe I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the President subsequently pronounced dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And about what time was that pronouncement made?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I could not give you the time within 5 or 10 minutes&mdash;I can tell
you this much, though, I know what actually did happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell me that.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I was&mdash;we pronounced him dead and I was in the room, present
while the priest gave him the last rites, during which time there was Dr. Jenkins
and Dr. Baxter and Dr. McClelland, Mrs. Kennedy, the priest, and myself.
Dr. Perry had left, as had most of the others by that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you remain?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, I just hadn't gotten out of the door when the priest first
came in and Dr. Jenkins asked everyone to leave except those people I have just
named.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did he exclude those from the group which were to leave?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, I think they were nurses, and several other people he
thought just best not remain and I'm sure that there was no intention to personally
exclude anyone behind his request. He just sort of looked around and
saw who appeared to be there and asked the others to leave.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the nature of the President's wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, as I mentioned, the neck wound had already been interfered
with by the tracheotomy at the time I got there, but I noticed the head
wound, and as I remember&mdash;I noticed that there was a large defect in the
occiput.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you notice in the occiput?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. It seemed to me that in the right occipitalparietal area that
there was a large defect. There appeared to be bone loss and brain loss in
the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any holes below the occiput, say, in this area
below here?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. No, I did not and at the time and the moments immediately following
the injury, we speculated as to whether he had been shot once or twice
because we saw the wound of entry in the throat and noted the large occipital
wound, and it is a known fact that high velocity missiles often have a small
wound of entrance and a large wound of exit, and I'm just giving you my
honest impressions at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were they?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, I wondered whether or not he had been shot once or twice&mdash;that
was my question at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "we speculate," whom do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Well, the doctors in attendance there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any doctor specifically?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I wouldn't mention anyone specifically, we all discussed it. I did
not know whether or not he had been shot once or twice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have an opportunity to observe the wound on his neck
prior to the time the tracheotomy was performed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. No, I did not. The tracheotomy was already being done by
Dr. Baxter and Dr. Perry when I got in the room. I did not see the wound
on his neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any written reports on the treatment of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. No, I did not; no one asked me to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you prepare any notes of any sort, or do you have any
notes of any sort?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. No; I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the cause of death in your opinion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I would assume that it was irreversible damage to the centers
in the brain which control the heart and respiration.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to any representatives of the Federal Government
about this matter prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. No; I have not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And prior to the time the court reporter came in, did you and
I have a brief discussion as to the nature of this deposition and the questions
that I would ask you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. No; I was not informed as to any specific questions. I knew
the general nature of the testimony which I would give.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From the discussion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. From the letter I had received from the counsel signed by Mr.
Rankin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you and I have a brief conversation here in this room
today before the court reporter came in?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Yes; we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of
assistance to the President's Commission in its investigation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. I do not&mdash;regarding the immediate condition of the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for coming, Dr. Peters, we are very
much obliged to you.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Peters</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Adolph Hartung Giesecke, Jr., was taken at 1:40 p.m.,
on March 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen
Specter, assistant counsel of the Presidents Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. A.&nbsp;H. Giesecke, Jr., is present in
response to a letter request from the Commission to appear at this deposition
proceeding in connection with the President's Commission to Investigate the
Assassination of President Kennedy, including his medical treatment at Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p>Dr. Giesecke has been asked to appear to testify about his knowledge of the
treatment that President Kennedy and Governor Connally received at Parkland
Hospital on November 22, and with that preliminary statement of purpose and
objective, would you please stand up, Dr. Giesecke, and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before this President's
Commission in these deposition proceedings will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name, please, for the record?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Adolph Hartung Giesecke, Jr. H-a-r-t-u-n-g (spelling).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. I am a physician and anesthesiologist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed to practice medicine in the State of Texas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you board-certified?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you working for board-certification?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline briefly your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. I graduated&mdash;how far back do you want me to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Start with college, graduation from college, if you would, please.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. I was on an accelerated plan through the University of Texas but
have no college degree. I matriculated to medical school in 1953, September 1953,
graduated May 30, 1957, from the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston,
Tex. I did my internship at William Beaumont Army Hospital at El
Paso, following which I served 24 months on active duty in the Army as an aviation
medical officer. I was stationed primarily at the Presidio at San Francisco,
Calif. Upon discharge from the Army, I came to Parkland Hospital, completed
a 3-year residency in anesthesiology in July 1963. Since that time I have been
an assistant professor on the anesthesiology staff at Southwestern Medical
School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to render medical attention to President
Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline the circumstances under which you were called
into that matter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. I was eating lunch in the cafeteria when Dr. Jenkins approached
the table and told me that the President had been shot and asked me
to bring some resuscitative equipment from the operating room to the emergency
room, which I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at what time did you arrive at the emergency room,
approximately?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Can I look and see when I induced the Governor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes. May the record show that Dr. Giesecke is now referring
to a letter from A.&nbsp;H. Giesecke, Jr., M.D., to Mr. C.&nbsp;J. Price, administrator,
dated November 25, 1963, which I will ask the reporter to mark as "Dr.
Giesecke's Exhibit No. 1."</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as "Dr. Giesecke Exhibit
No. 1," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let me ask you a question or two, first about this, Dr. Giesecke, to
qualify&mdash;is this a copy of the report which you submitted to Mr. Price?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes, that is a real copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And all the facts contained in this report are true and correct?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do they concern the treatment which was rendered by you
to President Kennedy and Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, refer to that if you wish, if it will help you answer the
last question.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. I arrived in the emergency room at 12:40 p.m., between 12:40
and 12:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was present at the time you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Dr. Jenkins was present, Dr. Carrico, Dr. Dulany, Dr. Baxter,
Dr. Perry, Dr. McClelland, and Drs. Akin and Hunt arrived at the same time
that I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other people present, such as nurses?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Mrs. Kennedy was in the room&mdash;I could not say&mdash;I can't say
who else was there. There may have been a nurse there, I just don't remember.
It seemed to me there was a Secret Service man there too, with Mrs.
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you sure Dr. Dulany was there, as distinguished from being
with Governor Connally?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I'm shaky on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The reason I asked you about that specifically is because
Dr. Carriro testified this morning that he and Dr. Dulany were on duty and
Dr. Dulany went immediately with Governor Connally and Dr. Carrico went
to President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. That may well be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the condition of the President when you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. There was a great deal of blood loss which was apparent when
he came in the room&mdash;the cart was covered with blood and there was a great
deal of blood on the floor. There was&mdash;I could see no spontaneous motion on
the part of the President. In other words, he made no movement during the
time that I was in the room. As I moved around towards the head of the
emergency cart with the anesthesia machine and the resuscitative equipment
and helped Dr. Jenkins to hook the anesthesia machine up to the President to
give him oxygen, I noticed that he had a very large cranial wound, with loss
of brain substance, and it seemed that most of the bleeding was coming from
the cranial wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe specifically as to the nature of the
cranial wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. It seemed that from the vertex to the left ear, and from
the browline to the occiput on the left-hand side of the head the cranium was
entirely missing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that the left-hand side of the head, or the right-hand side
of the head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. I would say the left, but this is just my memory of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's your recollection?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Right, like I say, I was there a very short time&mdash;really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any other wound or bullet hole below the large
area of missing skull?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. No; when I arrived the tracheotomy was in progress at that
time and so I observed no other wound except the one on the cranium.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the cranium itself, did you observe another bullet hole below
the portion of missing skull?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. No, sir; this was found later by Dr. Clark&mdash;I didn't see
this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What makes you say that that hole was found later by Dr.
Clark?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Well, this is hearsay&mdash;I wasn't there when they found it and
I didn't notice it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, Dr. Clark didn't observe that hole.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Oh, he didn't&mdash;I'm sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From whom did you hear that the hole had been observed, if
you recollect?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Oh&mdash;I must be confused. We talked to so many people about
these things&mdash;I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, with respect to the condition of the President's neck,
what was its status at the time you first observed it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Well, like I say, they were performing the tracheotomy, and
I personally saw no wound in the neck other than the tracheotomy wound.
As soon as the tracheotomy was completed, we removed the endotracheal
tube and hooked the anesthesia machine to the tracheotomy tube and efforts
were made then to put in a chest tube, an anterior chest tube.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were you with President Kennedy altogether?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Approximately 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now described everything which was done during the
time you were there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. No&mdash;after having assisted Dr. Jenkins in establishing a ventilation,
I then hooked up a cardiotachioscope or an electronic electrocardiographic
monitor to the President by putting needles in the skin and plugging the thing
in the wall, plugging the monitor in the wall. Before the machine had sufficient
time to warm up to see if there were any electrical activity, then I was
called out of the room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you have any occasion to return to the room where
the President was?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where were you called to?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. I was called across the hall where Governor Connally was
being moved out of the emergency treatment room and toward the operating
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action did you take at that time, if any?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. I had my equipment with me&mdash;I had taken my equipment with
me from the room where the President was, having ascertained that Dr. Jenkins
didn't need anything that I had, and so I proceeded to the elevator. We moved
the equipment and the Governor&mdash;the Governor went on the first elevator
and I caught the second one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you go on the second elevator?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. To the second floor where the operating suite is, moved off of
the elevator and down to operating room 5, which was being set up for the
Governor. The Governor had arrived and I obtained from the anesthesia orderly
an anesthesia machine, checked it for safe operation, and discussed the Governor's
condition a little bit with him, and determined that he was conscious
and that he could respond to questions and that he hadn't eaten in the previous
several hours, and proceeded to induce an anesthesia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, are all the details of your activity in connection with
Governor Connally's operation contained in the report marked "Dr. Giesecke's
Exhibit No. 1"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you mentioned a few minutes ago that you talked about
this matter with a number of people&mdash;whom have you talked to, Dr. Giesecke?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Well, of course, we discussed it with Dr. Jenkins and various
members of the anesthesia staff. We have discussed it with&mdash;I've forgotten
that gentleman's name, but he was from the American Medical Association, as
a historian. We discussed it with Dr. Mike Bush, who then reported it in the
Anesthesiology Newsletter, which is a publication of the American Society of
Anesthesiologists, and then discussed it with the Secretary of&mdash;may I retract
that. That's about it&mdash;that's the extent of the discussion, except with other
members of the surgical staff and the anesthesia staff and these people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever discussed this matter with any representative of
the Federal Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes; there was a well documented Secret Service man here
who said he was from the Warren Commission about a month ago, I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by "well documented"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Well, I mean he had a badge and a card and he seemed to be
legitimate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you tell him, if anything?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. He was asking rather specifically if we had made other notes
than the reports that we had already submitted, so in essence it was just a
matter of telling him, "No, I didn't have any other information written down
except what I had already given."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what had you already given&mdash;that letter report?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That is marked "Giesecke Exhibit No. 1"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Has any other representative talked to you from the Federal
Government about this matter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This afternoon prior to the time we went on the record, did I
ask you a few questions and discuss the nature of this deposition proceeding,
and did you give me information just as you have on the record here after
the court reporter started to take everything down?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Yes; that's correct. She was out of the room for a few minutes
before we started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be helpful
to the Warren Commission in its investigation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. No, I think that pretty well covers what I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May I thank you very much, Dr. Giesecke? That's fine.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Giesecke</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your profession?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Medical doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, are you duly licensed to practice medicine by the State
of Texas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And in what year were you so licensed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. 1950.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline briefly your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I graduated from medical school at Tulane College of Medicine in
1949. I had a year of rotating internship followed by a year of pediatric
residency. In 1961 I started a residency in anesthesiology, which I completed in
1963, and I am now a fellow in anesthesiology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you board certified, then, Dr. Hunt, at this time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you working toward board certification?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes, I am. I am eligible and will take the first part in June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion on November 22 to render medical aid to
the late President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your being
called into the case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I was in Parkland Hospital on duty with the anesthesiology department
and was notified by our chief of staff, Dr. M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins, that the President
had been shot. Together with Dr. Giesecke and Dr. Akin, I got an
anesthesia machine and put it on an elevator and checked it out and set it up
on the way to the emergency room and took it into the emergency room where
the President was and he had been intubated, and I helped Dr. Jenkins connect
the anesthesia machine to the endotracheal tube which at that time was being
run, I believe, by a Bird machine, and after making certain that the connections
were properly done, I placed the equipment in Dr. Jenkins' hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors were present when you arrived there, Dr. Hunt?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Dr. Jenkins, Dr. Malc Perry&mdash;quite a number of others&mdash;I just
can't remember who was there today.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were any nurses present?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes&mdash;I don't know the names of any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, did you observe as to the condition of
President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. The first good look I took at him I noticed that his eyes were opened
and that the pupils were widely dilated and fixed and so I assumed that he
was in essence dead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time did you arrive in the emergency
room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I don't know&mdash;it would have been&mdash;I would think near 12:45, but
I have really never even thought about it and I frankly don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long after you arrived did you have an opportunity to
observe the President in the way which you have just described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. How long was it from the time I came in until I looked at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. A minute&mdash;2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any other observations at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No&mdash;other than that everyone was working on him. They were
doing cardiac massage, closed chest massage, I.V.'s were running, and others
were being started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I.V.'s?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Intravenous fluids and, of course, our department was breathing
for him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you say "breathing for him," what do you mean by
that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Ventilating him&mdash;an endotracheal tube down into the trachea
attached to an anesthesia machine with 100 percent oxygen going, and by manual
compression of the bag, ventilating him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any wounds on the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I actually did not see the wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you at any time see a wound to the head?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No; I didn't see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was there something obscuring your view from seeing
the head wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes; I could see his face and I could also see that a great deal of
blood was running off of the table from his right side and I was on his left
side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you near his head or foot or the middle of the body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I was about midbody actually, well, no&mdash;more at his shoulder,
when I leaned over to look at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever observe any wound in the neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I did not actually see the wound in the neck. I say that because
I assumed there was a wound&mdash;someone's hand was there and there was blood
present, but there was blood on nearly everyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the condition of his throat when you first observed
him, if you did observe it at all?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I couldn't&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I can't say. You mean, as far as
inside or outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Outside.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I don't actually remember seeing anything except someone's hands
were using a sponge or something was present in the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What medical operation, if any, was performed on his throat?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe a tracheotomy being performed on his throat?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No&mdash;that's not to say that they were not doing one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else was done for the President other than that which
you have already described?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Well, let's see, I don't&mdash;as far as actual observation, I didn't&mdash;other
things were done&mdash;I left at this time and went to Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At about what time did you leave President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I was probably in the room no more than 4 minutes at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had he been pronounced dead by the time you left?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No; he had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you go when you left the President's room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Straight across to operating room 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you find in operating room 2 when you arrived
there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Governor Connally was present there <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors, if any, were present when you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Red Duke&mdash;I'm sorry, I just don't remember who the others were.
There were three or four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action was being taken with respect to Governor Connally
upon your arrival there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. They were placing chest tubes, as a matter of fact, they had one
in and were putting the other one in, and were&mdash;they had an I.V. going, I believe
someone had done a cutdown, and they were checking other wounds. He had
a wound on his arm and another wound down on his leg, I think, and that
was about it&mdash;preparing to take him promptly up to surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do on that occasion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I walked in and Dr. Duke looked up and the first thing I did was to
look at the Governor&mdash;I took his pulse and he spoke to me and said something,
and noted his color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did the Governor say to you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. He said something like, "It hurts," not anything real specific, but
he did at least speak, and it was a conscious thought type of thing, so that he
was more or less alert, responding, so then I stepped back into the hall and
signaled a fellow, a medical student who has been in our department, that is
rotating through anesthesia, and I happened to see him just outside the door,
and I asked him to please go upstairs and bring me another unit of equipment
and then came back in and told Dr. Duke I had sent for equipment, although
I didn't believe the Governor was going to need it, and he said that he was very
glad that I had and he, too, didn't think he would need it, but he should have it
as a standby, and then they brought me a machine and my table down and I
stayed with the Governor until he was ready to go upstairs, but he did not
require any respiratory aid because he was not that critical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you participate any further with the treatment of Governor
Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. When we were ready to go upstairs, I went back to the room
where the President was and Dr. Giesecke, who is a staff member from our
department, appeared relatively free and I asked him if he would come and
go upstairs with the Governor and I came on upstairs in a different route.
I didn't go in the elevator with the Governor&mdash;Dr. Giesecke went with him,
and helped Dr. Giesecke get under way with the surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How did you go upstairs, by what route?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I don't know&mdash;I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any other elevator going up to the operating rooms?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes; there are four elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But do those lead from the emergency rooms?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No; you come down this long hallway up to those of the ground
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there more than one elevator for the stretcher to go through
from the emergency room up to the second floor operating rooms?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes; they can&mdash;they come up to these.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What route would they have to take to do this?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. They would have to come directly out of the emergency room and
down this main hallway to this front bank of elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would be a pretty long route, would it not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Actually, it isn't very long. I don't know in yards or paces even,
but there are three elevators there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What route did Governor Connally use?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I think they took him by the back elevator, the one that comes
down into the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the one they customarily use to take people from the
emergency area into the operating room?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes; if there is an emergency it goes straight up&mdash;they usually
use that one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say you went back to President Kennedy's room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you observe there at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. At that time I did notice, and possibly this was there earlier,
I noticed that they had gotten more monitoring equipment in and connected
the electronic equipment for monitoring the electrocardiogram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time did you return to President Kennedy's room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I don't know&mdash;it would probably have been maybe 3 or 4 or 5
minutes from the time I stepped out, because I went across the hall&mdash;I didn't
know the Governor was there, and someone told me and I went in and just took
a brief look at him to sort of size up his condition, and stepped out and sent for
my equipment and went back in and stayed until they brought my equipment.
It would have been a little longer than 4 or 5 minutes because they had to bring
the equipment down the elevator and it had arrived and been there a few
minutes&mdash;3 or 4 minutes before we were ready to take him upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was going on in the President's room when you
returned there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Well, there were still a goodly number of people, oh, at least 10
people, possibly there were more&mdash;I'm not real sure, but there were still&mdash;at
that time there were, I know, at least three anesthesiologists in there&mdash;Dr.
Jenkins, Dr. Akin, and Dr. Giesecke, and I believe Dr. Baxter was in there,
and Dr. Perry was still there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were they still working on the President at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes, sir; I don't know what they were doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long did you stay on that occasion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Just, oh, a minute&mdash;just long enough to catch Dr. Giesecke's eye
and let him know I was there and going out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you ever return to the President's room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No; I don't believe I did&mdash;no; I'm sure I didn't, because I came
on upstairs with Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you participate then with Governor Connally's operation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. I helped Dr. Giesecke during the induction of anesthesia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to any representative of the Federal Government
prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any written report of your participation in the
care of Governor Connally and President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Not directly. Dr. Giesecke called me one day and said that, I
think it was the A.M.A. was here and just wanted to verify my movements for
the day, which I told him and he in turn told them that&mdash;I did not appear
before them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you make any written reports yourself?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any notes of any sort concerning your participation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Prior to the time the court reporter started to take down the
transcript of my questions and your answers, did you and I have a brief discussion
about the purpose of this deposition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the questions I would ask you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is the information which you have provided on the record
the same as you told me before the written deposition started?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Elaborated somewhat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of aid
to the Commission in its investigation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for appearing, Dr. Hunt.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Hunt</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Kenneth Everett Salyer was taken at 6:15 p.m., on
March 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Kenneth Salyer is present in
response to an inquiry that he appear to have his deposition taken in connection
with the inquiries being conducted by the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy, which is looking into all facts of the shooting,
including the wounds of the President and the care he received at Parkland
Hospital.</p>

<p>With that preliminary statement of purpose, Dr. Salyer, will you stand up
and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you will give before the President's
Commission in the course of this deposition will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you had an opportunity to examine the document or the
Executive order creating the President's Commission and Rules for the taking
of testimony?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you willing to have your deposition taken today without
having the formal three days of written notice, which you have a right to, if
you wish?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are willing to waive that right, is that right?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Kenneth Everett Salyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Physician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed to practice medicine by the State of Texas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you outline briefly your educational background,
please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. A B.S. degree at the University of Kansas, an M.D. degree at the
University of Kansas, and internship at Parkland, and now a first year resident
in surgery at Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what year did you graduate from the University of Kansas
Medical School?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. 1962.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how old are you, Dr. Salyer?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. I am 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your being
called in to assist in the treatment of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Well, for the month of November, as part of our rotation on surgery,
I spent that month on neurosurgery, and being on call that day for any
emergencies which come in to our emergency room related to neurosurgical
problems, we would be called down to the emergency room to see these, and I
was upstairs viewing a movie when I heard that the President had arrived and
so I thought I should go down to the emergency room and see what the situation
was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, upon your arrival at the emergency room, who was present?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Oh, I don't recall&mdash;I know that there were a room full of doctors&mdash;I
could list specific ones that I remember if you would like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. I don't really think I could give you every one, but I remember
Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Perry and Dr. Baxter, and also Dr. Bob McClelland and
Dr. Carrico and Dr. Crenshaw, and I think a Dr. Gene Akin was there also&mdash;at
that time, when I first came in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you think of any others?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. No; I don't recall any others&mdash;there could have been some, there
were a lot of people sort of moving in and out. There certainly were a lot of
nurses in there at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify any of the nurses who were there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. No; I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the President's condition at the time you arrived?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. It was critical.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe about him with respect to any wounds he
may have sustained?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Well, I observed that he did have some sucking wound of some
type on his neck, and that he also had a wound of his right temporal region&mdash;these
were the two main wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have an opportunity to observe his throat?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. No; I really did not. I think there were a lot of people&mdash;a
lot of doctors more closely around him. I might mention also, I think just
right after I came in the room Dr. Clark and Dr. Grossman also arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor who?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Dr. Grossman, just briefly. He's a neurosurgeon also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Dr. Grossman&mdash;Bob Grossman. He was just there, I think,
briefly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long was he there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. I couldn't say&mdash;I'm not sure he came in the room. I know they
were together&mdash;I cannot say that for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To what extent did Dr. Crenshaw participate?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Dr. Crenshaw participated about the extent that I did. We were
occupied in making sure an I.V. was going and hanging up a bottle of blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is the&mdash;is Dr. Crenshaw a resident?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Yes, he is third-year resident. That's the reason I remember
him specifically because we were sort of working there together on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I had asked you a moment ago whether you had an opportunity
to observe the condition of the President's throat.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your answer to that question?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. The answer was&mdash;there were a lot of doctors standing around,
and I didn't really get to observe the nature of the wound in the throat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time did you arrive at the emergency
room where the President was situated?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. I really don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done for the President by way of treatment that you
observed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Well, an adequate airway eventually, of course, some external
cardiac massage&mdash;he had I.V.'s&mdash;intravenous fluids going in a number of sites,
and all of the acute measures we administered him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I didn't hear you at the end of your answer.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. I said&mdash;all of the many other measures that we administered&mdash;I
don't recall specifically some of the other details as far as medications and
so forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe with respect to the head wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. I came in on the left side of him and noticed that his major
wound seemed to be in his right temporal area, at least from the point of
view that I could see him, and other than that&mdash;nothing other than he did have
a gaping scalp wound&mdash;cranial wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Has anyone from the Federal Government talked to you about
your observations of this matter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. No one has.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think may be of aid to
the President's Commission in its inquiry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. No, I believe not.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. Salyer.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Salyer</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Martin G. White was taken at 6:35 p.m., on March 25,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Martin White is present in response
to a request that he appear to have his deposition taken because he has
been identified in prior depositions as being one of the doctors in attendance on
President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Dr. White, have you had an opportunity to examine the Executive order
creating the Presidential Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you had an opportunity to examine the resolution setting
forth the rules for taking depositions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you willing to have your deposition taken without the 3-day
notice to which you have a right under the rules, if you wish to receive formal
written notice? And have three days after mailing before you appear to have
your deposition taken?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. No, I want to have it taken now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are willing to waive that requirement?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you stand up, then, and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the President's
Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Martin G. White.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. M.D.&mdash;physician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you duly licensed in the State of Texas to practice medicine?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. In this institution.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I have a bachelor of medicine degree from Northwestern University
and a master of science degree from Northwestern University and a
doctor of medicine degree from Northwestern University.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How old are you, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Twenty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you in attendance when President Kennedy was being
treated on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what were the circumstances of your being called into the
case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I was the intern assigned to the surgery section of the emergency
room on that day and was there when the President's body was brought into
the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do in connection with the President's treatment?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I put an intervenous cutdown in the President's right foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have an opportunity to observe any of his wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I saw the wound in his head as he was brought into the trauma
room where he was treated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any other wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. No, I did not see any other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe specifically a wound in the neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I did not look and did not observe any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were you present while the President was being
treated?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I would estimate about 10 to 15 minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you leave prior to the time he was pronounced to be
dead?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you leave?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. My duties had been completed and there was work elsewhere, with
the Governor, to be done.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was present at the time you were there, Dr. White?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. As best I can recall, Dr. Carrico and I were the physicians immediately
present when the President's body was brought in, plus a number of
individuals who accompanied the cart on which his body was lying, and the
only individual who I knew in that group was his wife, Mrs. Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what doctors were present at the time you left the room?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Well, it would be impossible for me to tell you all the people that
were there, but I knew Dr. Carrico, Dr. Baxter, Dr. Perry and Dr. Zedelitz,
Z-e-d-e-l-i-t-z (spelling)&mdash;I know they were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor who&mdash;what is his first name?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. William Zedelitz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To what extent did he participate?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I don't believe that he had any&mdash;I don't know what he did other
than the fact that when I was doing the cutdown he assisted me by just placing
some tape over the catheters we used to do this with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is he an intern as you are?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. He is a surgical resident here at this hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who else was present?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. I can't be sure that I saw anyone else, although, as I say&mdash;many
people were there whose faces I can't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify any of the nurses who were present?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Yes; one of the nurses&mdash;there were two there, Jeanette, and her
last name&mdash;I don't know at the present time, and she is chief nurse in the
emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doris Nelson?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Jeanette Standridge?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. Yes; Jeanette Standridge was the other nurse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think might be of help
to the Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. White for coming.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">White</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Robert Shaw was taken at 6 p.m., on March 23, 1964,
at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Robert Shaw is present, having
responded to a request to have his deposition taken in connection with the
President's Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, which is
investigating all facts relating to the medical care of President Kennedy and
Governor Connally, and Dr. Shaw has been requested to appear and testify
concerning the treatment on Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Dr. Shaw, will you rise and raise your right hand, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the President's
Commission in the course of this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Robert Roeder Shaw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Physician and surgeon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline briefly your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I received my B.A. degree from the University of Michigan in 1927
and M.D. degree in 1933. My surgical training was obtained at Roosevelt
Hospital in New York City, July 1934 to July 1936, and my training in thoracic
surgery at the University Hospital, Ann Arbor, Mich., July 1936 to July 1938.
Do you want me to say what happened subsequent to then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; will you outline your medical career in brief form subsequent
to that date, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I entered private practice, limited to thoracic surgery, August 1,
1938. I have continuously practiced this specialty in Dallas, with the exception
of the period from June 1942 to December 1945, when I was a member of the
Medical Corps of the Army of the United States, serving almost all of this period
in the European theatre of operations. I was again absent from Dallas from
December 1961 until June 1963, when I headed the medico team and performed
surgery at the Avicenna Hospital at Kabul, Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you Board certified, Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes. I am certified by the Board of Thoracic Surgery, date of
certification&mdash;1948. At the present time I am professor of thoracic surgery and
chairman of the division of thoracic surgery at the University of Texas, Southwestern
Medical School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to perform any medical care for President
Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to care for Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you relate the circumstances of your being called in to
care for the Governor, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I was returning to Parkland Hospital and the medical school
from a conference I had attended at Woodlawn Hospital, which is approximately
a mile away, when I saw an open limousine going past the intersection of
Industrial Boulevard and Harry Hines Boulevard under police escort. As soon
as traffic had cleared, I proceeded on to the medical school. On the car radio
I heard that the President had been shot at while riding in the motorcade.
Upon entering the medical school, a medical student came in and joined three
other medical students. He stated that President Kennedy had been brought in
dead on arrival to the emergency room of Parkland Hospital and that Governor
Connally had been shot through the chest. Upon hearing this, I proceeded
immediately to the emergency room of the hospital and arrived at the emergency
room approximately 5 minutes after the President and Governor Connally had
arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you find Governor Connally at that time, Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I found Governor Connally lying on a stretcher in emergency
room No. 2. In attendance were several men, Dr. James Duke, Dr. David
Mebane, Dr. Giesecke, an anesthesiologist. As emergency measures, the open
wound on the Governor's right chest had been covered with a heavy dressing
and manual pressure was being applied. A drainage tube had been inserted
into the second interspace in the anterior portion of the right chest and connected
to a water-sealed bottle to bring about partial reexpansion of the
collapsed right lung. An intravenous needle had been inserted into a vein
in the left arm and intravenous fluid was running.</p>

<p>I was informed by Dr. Duke that blood had already been drawn and sent
to the laboratory to be crossmatched with 4 pints of blood, to be available
at surgery. He also stated that the operating room had been alerted and that
they were merely waiting for my arrival to take the Governor to surgery,
since it was obvious that the wound would have to be debrided and closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what time did the operation actually start, Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. That, I would have to refresh my memory on that&mdash;now, this,
of course&mdash;the point he began the anesthesia&mdash;that would be about right&mdash;but
I have to refresh my memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Permit me to make available on the record for you the operative
record which has been heretofore marked as Commission Exhibit No. 392,
with the exhibit consisting of the records of Parkland Hospital on President
Kennedy as well as Governor Connally and I call your attention to a 2-page
report which bears your name as the surgeon, under date of November 22,
1963, of thoracic surgery for Governor Connally, and, first, I ask you if in fact
this report was prepared by you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, with that report, is your recollection refreshed as to
the starting time of the operation on Governor Connally's chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; the anesthesia was begun at 1300 hours.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which would be 1 p.m.?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. 1 p.m., and the actual incision was made at 1335 or 1:35 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what time did that operation conclude?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. My operation was completed at 1520 hours, or 3:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe Governor Connally's condition, Dr. Shaw,
directing your attention first to the wound on his back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. When Governor Connally was examined, it was found that there
was a small wound of entrance, roughly elliptical in shape, and approximately
a cm. and a half in its longest diameter, in the right posterior shoulder, which
is medial to the fold of the axilla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the axilla, in lay language, Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. The arm pit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shaw, will you describe next the wound of exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; the wound of exit was below and slightly medial to the nipple
on the anterior right chest. It was a round, ragged wound, approximately 5
cm. in diameter. This wound had obviously torn the pleura, since it was
a sucking wound, allowing air to pass to and fro between the pleura cavity
and the outside of the body.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Define the pleura, please, Doctor, in lay language.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. The pleura is the lining of the chest cavity with one layer of pleura,
the parietal pleura lining the inside of the chest wall, diaphragm and the
mediastinum, which is the compartment of the body containing the heart, its
pericardial sac, and great vessels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the characteristics of these two bullet wounds
which led you to believe that one was a wound of entry and one was a wound
of exit, Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. The wound of entrance is almost invariably the smaller wound,
since it perforates the skin and makes a wound approximately or slightly
larger than the missile. The wound of exit, especially if it has shattered
any bony material in the body, will be the larger of the wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What experience, Doctor, have you had, if any, in evaluating
gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I have had considerable experience with gunshot wounds and
wounds due to missiles because of my war experience. This experience was
not only during the almost 2 years in England, but during the time that I was
head of the Thoracic Center in Paris, France, for a period of approximately a
year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you be able to give an approximation of the total number
of bullet wounds you have had occasion to observe and treat?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Considering the war experience and the addition of wounds
seen in civilian practice, it probably would number well over a thousand,
since we had over 900 admissions to the hospital in Paris.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the line of trajectory, Dr. Shaw, between the point
in the back of the Governor and the point in the front of the Governor, where
the bullet wounds were observed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Considering the wound of entrance and the wound of exit, the trajectory
of the bullet was obliquely downward, considering the fact that the
Governor was in a sitting position at the time of wounding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As an illustrative guide here, Dr. <span class="locked">Shaw&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. May I add one sentence there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Please do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. The bullet, in passing through the Governor's chest wall struck
the fifth rib at its midpoint and roughly followed the slanting direction of the
fifth rib, shattering approximately 10 cm. of the rib. The intercostal muscle
bundle above the fifth rib and below the fifth rib were surprisingly spared from
injury by the shattering of the rib, which again establishes the trajectory of
the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would the shattering of the rib have had any effect in deflecting
the path of the bullet from a straight line?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. It could have, except that in the case of this injury, the rib was
obviously struck so that not too dense cancellus portion of the rib in this position
was carried away by the bullet and probably there was very little in the way of
deflection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At this time, Dr. Shaw, I would like to call your attention to
an exhibit which we have already had marked as Dr. Gregory's Exhibit No. 1,
because we have used this in the course of his deposition earlier today and
this is a body diagram, and I ask you, first of all, looking at Diagram No. 1,
to comment as to whether the point of entry marked on the right shoulder
of Governor Connally is accurate?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes. The point of entry as marked on this exhibit I consider
to be quite accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is the size and dimension of the hole accurate on scale, or
would you care to make any adjustment or modification in that characterization
by picture?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. As the wound entry is marked on this figure, I would say that
the scale is larger than the actual wound or the actual depicting of the wound
should be. As I described it, it was approximately a centimeter and a half
in length.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you draw, Dr. Shaw, right above the shoulder as best
you can recollect, what that wound of entry appeared at the time you first
observed it? Would you put your initials right beside that?</p>

<p>(The witness, Dr. Shaw, complied with the request of Counsel Specter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, directing your attention to the figure right beside, showing
the front view, does the point of exit on the lower chest of the figure there
correspond with the point of exit on the body of Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; I would say that it conforms in every way except that it
was a little nearer to the right nipple than depicted here.</p>

<p>Off the record, just a minute.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Shaw, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shaw, in our off-the-record conversation, you called my
attention to your thought that the nipple line is incorrectly depicted on that
figure, would you, therefore, in ink mark on there the nipple line which would
be more accurate proportionately to that body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; I feel the nipple line as shown on this figure is a little high and
should be placed at a lower point on the body, which would bring the wound
of exit, which I feel is in the proper position, more in line with the actual
position of the nipple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, with the wound of exit as it is shown there, does that
correspond in position with the actual situation on Governor Connally's body
as you have redrawn the proportion to the nipple line?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. It does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you put an "X" through the old nipple line so we have
obscured that and put your initials beside those two marks, if you would, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. By the "X-1"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, please.</p>

<p>(The witness, Dr. Shaw, complied with request of Counsel Specter in drawing
on the figure heretofore mentioned.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as to the proportion of the hole depicting the point of
exit, is that correct with respect to characterizing the situation on Governor
Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. It is, and corresponds with the relative size of the two wounds
as I have shown on the other figure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you at this time, right above the right shoulder there,
draw the appearances of the point of exit as nearly as you can recollect it on
Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. This is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say the hole which appears on Governor Connally is just
about the size that it would have been on his body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; it is drawn in good scale.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In good scale to the body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you draw it on another portion of the paper here in
terms of its absolute size?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Five cm. it would be&mdash;about like that&mdash;do you want me to mark
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Put your initials right in the center of that circle.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I'll just put "wound of exit."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine&mdash;just put "wound of exit&mdash;actual size" and put your initials
under it.</p>

<p>(The witness, Dr. Shaw, complied with request of Counsel Specter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that Dr. Shaw has marked "wound of
exit&mdash;actual size" with his initials R.R.S. on the diagram 1.</p>

<p>Now, looking at diagram 2, Dr. Shaw, does the angle of declination on the
figure correspond with the angle that the bullet passed through Governor
Connally's chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. It does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any feature of diagram 3 which is useful in further
elaborating that which you have commented about on diagram 1?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. No. Again off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Shaw, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have just commented off the record, Dr. Shaw, that the
wound of entry is too large proportionately to the wound of exit, but aside from
that, is there anything else on diagram 3 which will be helpful to us?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there anything else on diagram 4 which would be helpful
by way of elaborating that which appeared on diagram 2?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now as to the treatment or operative procedure which you
performed on Governor Connally, would you now describe what you did for
him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. As soon as anesthesia had been established and an endotracheal
tube was in place so that respiration could be controlled with positive pressure,
the large occlusive dressing which had been applied in the emergency room
was removed. This permitted better inspection of the wound of exit, air passed
to and fro through the damaged chest wall, there was obvious softening of
the bony framework of the chest wall as evidenced by exaggerated motion
underneath the skin along the line of the trajectory of the missile.</p>

<p>The skin of the chest wall axilla and back were thoroughly cleaned and
aseptic solution was applied for further cleaning of the skin, the whole area
was draped so as to permit access to both the wound of exit and the entrance
wound. Temporarily, the wound of entrance was covered with a sterile towel.</p>

<p>First an elliptical incision was made to remove the ragged edges of the
wound of exit. This incision was then extended laterally and upward in a
curved direction so as to not have the incision through the skin and subcutaneous
tissue directly over the line of the trajectory of the bullet where the chest had
been softened.</p>

<p>It was found that approximately 10 cm. of the fifth rib had been shattered
and the rib fragments acting as secondary missiles had been the major contributing
factor to the damage to the anterior chest wall and to the underlying
lung.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean, Doctor, by the words "fragments acting as
secondary missiles"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. When bone is struck by a high velocity missile it fragments and
acts much like bowling pins when they are struck by a bowling ball&mdash;they fly
in all directions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you continue now and further describe the treatment
which you performed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. The bony fragments were removed along with all obviously
damaged muscle. It was found that the fourth and fifth intercoastal muscle
bundles were almost completely intact where the rib had been stripped out.
There was damage to the latissimus dorsi muscle, but this was more in the
way of laceration, so that the damage could be repaired by suture. The portion
of parietal pleura which had not been torn by the injury was opened along the
length of the resected portion of the fifth rib. The jagged ends of the fifth rib
were cleaned with a rongeur; approximately 200 cc. of clot and liquid blood was
removed from the pleura cavity; inspection of the lung revealed that the middle
lobe had a long tear which separated the lobe into approximately two equal segments.
This tear extended up into the hilum of the lobe, but had not torn a major
bronchus or a major blood vessel. The middle lobe was repaired with a running
No. 3 O chromic gut approximating the tissue of the depths of the lobe, with
two sutures, and then approximating the visceral pleura on both the medial
and lateral surface with a running suture of the same material&mdash;same gut.</p>

<p>Upon repair of the lobe it expanded well upon pressure on the anesthetic
bag with very little in the way of peripheral leak.</p>

<p>Attention was next turned to the lower lobe. There was a large hematoma
in the anterior basal segment of the right lower lobe extending on into the
median basal segment. At one point there was a laceration in the surface of
the lobe approximating a centimeter in length, undoubtedly caused by one of the
penetrating rib fragments. A single mattress suture No. 3 O chromic gut
on an atromitac needle was used to close this laceration from which blood was
oozing.</p>

<p>Next, the diaphragm and all parts of the right mediastinum was examined
but no injury was found.</p>

<p>The portion of the drainage tube which had already been placed in the second
interspace in the anterior axillary line which protruded into the chest was cut
away, since it was deemed to be longer than necessary. A second drainage tube
was placed through a stab wound in the eighth interspace in the posterior axillary
line and both of these tubes were connected to a water sealed bottle. The fourth
and fifth intercoastal muscle bundles were then approximated with interrupted
sutures of No. O chromic gut.</p>

<p>The remaining portion of the serratus anterior muscle was then approximated
across the closure of the intercostal muscles. The laceration at the latissimus
dorsi muscle was then approximated with No. O chromic guts suture. Before
closing the skin and subcutaneous tissue a stab wound approximately 2 cm. in
length was made near the lower tip of the right scapula and a latex rubber
drain was drawn up through this stab wound to drain subscapular space. This
drain was marked with a safety pin. The subcutaneous tissue was then closed
with interrupted sutures of No. O chromic gut, inverting the knots. The skin
was closed with interrupted vertical mattress sutures of black silk.</p>

<p>Attention was next turned to the wound of entrance. The skin surrounding
the wound was removed in an elliptical fashion, enlarging the incision to approximately
3 cm. Examination of the depths of this wound reveal that the
latissimus dorsi muscle alone was injured, and the latex rubber drain could be
felt immediately below the laceration in the muscle. A single mattress suture
was used to close the laceration in the muscle. The skin was then closed with
interrupted vertical mattress sutures of black silk. The drainage tubes going
into the pleura cavity were then secured with safety pins and adhesive tape
and a dressing applied to the entire incision. This concluded the operation for
the wound of the chest, and at this point Dr. Gregory and Dr. Shires entered
the operating room to care for the wounds of the right wrist and left thigh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe, Dr. Shaw, as to the wound of the right
wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Well, I would have to say that my observations are probably not
accurate. I knew that the wound of the wrist had fractured the lower end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
the right radius and I saw one large wound on the&mdash;I guess you would call it the
volar surface of the right arm and a small wound on the dorsum of the right
wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which appeared to you to be the point of entrance, Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. To me, I felt that the wound of entrance was the wound on the
volar surface or the anterior surface with the hand held in the upright or
the supine position, with the wound of exit being the small wound on the
dorsum.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the characteristics of those wounds which led you
to that conclusion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Although the wound of entrance, I mean, although the wound
that I felt was a wound of entrance was the larger of the two, it was my
feeling that considering the large wound of exit from the chest, that this was
consistent with the wound that I saw on the wrist. May we go off the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness Dr. Shaw off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, let's go back on the record.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I'll start by saying that my examination of the wrist was a cursory
one because I realized that Dr. Gregory was going to have the responsibility
of doing what was necessary surgically for this wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you conferred with him preliminarily to starting your
operation on the chest so that you knew he would be standing by, I believe as
you testified earlier, to perform the wrist operation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes&mdash;Dr. Gregory was in the hallway of the operating room before
I went in to operate on Governor Connally and while I was scrubbing preparatory
to the operation, I told him that there was a compound comminuted fracture
of the radius of the Governor's right hand that would need his attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that while we were off the record here
a moment ago, Dr. Shaw, you and I were discussing the possible angles at
which the Governor might have been sitting in relation to a trajectory of a
bullet consistent with the observations which you recollect and consistent with
what seems to have been a natural position for the Governor to have maintained,
in the light of your view of the situation. And with that in mind, let me
resume the questioning and put on the record very much of the comments and
observations you were making as you and I were discussing off the record as
this deposition has proceeded.</p>

<p>Now, you have described a larger wound on the volar or palm side of the
wrist than was present on the dorsal or back side of the wrist, and you have
expressed the opinion that it was the point of entry on the volar side of the
wrist as opposed to a point of exit on the back side of the wrist, even though
as you earlier said, ordinarily the point of entry is smaller and the point of
exit is larger.</p>

<p>Now, will you repeat for the record, Dr. Shaw, the thinking&mdash;your thinking
which might explain a larger point of entry and a smaller point of exit on the
wrist.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes. As a matter of fact, when I first examined Governor Connally's
wrist, I did not notice the small wound on the dorsum of the wrist and
only saw the much larger wound on the radial side of the volar surface of the
wrist. I didn't know about the second small wound until I came in when Dr.
Gregory was concluding his operation on the wrist. He informed me that there
was another small wound through the skin through which a missile had obviously
passed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, which wound was that, Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. This was the wound on the dorsum or the dorsal surface of the
wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you then observe that wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; I saw this wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where was that wound located to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. This wound was slightly more distal on the arm than the larger
wound and located almost in the midportion of the dorsum of the wrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that correspond with this location which I read from
Dr. Gregory's report on the dorsal aspect of the right wrist over the junction
of the distal fourth of the radius and shaft approximately 2 cm. in length.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. The wound was approximately 2 cm. in length?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; would that correspond with the wound which you observed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; I saw it at the time that he was closing it and that would
correspond with the wound I observed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He has described that as what he concluded to be the wound of
entry on the dorsal aspect of the right wrist, but your thought was that perhaps
that was the wound of exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; in trying to reconstruct the position of Governor Connally's
body, sitting in the jump seat of the limousine, and the attitude that he would
assume in turning to the right&mdash;this motion would naturally bring the volar
surface of the right wrist in contact with the anterior portion of the right
chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, is your principal reason for thinking that the wound on
the dorsal aspect is a wound of exit rather than a wound of entry because of
what you consider to be the awkward position in having the dorsal aspect of the
wrist either pointing upward or toward the chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes, I think I am influenced a great deal by the fact that in trying
to assume this position, I can't comfortably turn my arm into a position that
would explain the wound of the dorsal surface of the wrist as a wound of
entrance, knowing where the missile came out of the chest and assuming that
one missile caused both the chest wound and the arm wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Might not then that conclusion be affected if you discard the assumption
that one missile caused all the wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes, if two missiles struck the Governor, then it would not be
necessary to assume that the larger wound is the wound of entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would not another explanation for the presence of a wound
on the dorsal aspect of the wrist be if the Governor were sitting in an upright
position on the jump seat with his arm resting either on an arm rest inside the
car or on a window of the car with the elbow protruding outward, and as he
turned around, turning in a rotary motion, his wrist somewhat toward his body
so that it was present in an angle of approximately 45 degrees to his body, being
slightly moving toward his body.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Well, I myself, am not able to get my arm into that position.
If the wound, as I assume to be in the midportion of the forearm here and the
wound of exit would be here (illustrating) I can't get my arm into that position
as to correspond to what we know about the trajectory of the bullet into the
chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Assuming that the bullet through the chest then also went
through the wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, aside from the trajectory and the explanation of one bullet
causing all the damage and focusing just on the nature of the wound on the
wrist, what conclusion would you reach as to which was the point of entrance
and which was the point of exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I would feel that the wound on the volar surface of the wrist was
the wound of entrance and that perhaps the bullet being partially spent by its
passage through the chest wall, struck the radius, fragmenting it, but didn't
pass through the wrist, and perhaps tumbled out into the clothing of Governor
Connally with only a small fragment of this bullet passing on through the wrist
to go out into the left thigh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would that be consistent with a fragment passing through
the wrist which was so small that virtually the entire missile, or 158 grains of it,
would remain in the central missile?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes. The wound on the volar surface, I'm sorry, on the dorsum
of the wrist and the wound in the thigh which was obviously a wound of entrance,
since the fragment is still within the thigh, were not too dissimilar in
size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was the wound in the thigh itself, that is, aside from the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
of the fragment which remains in the leg, as small as the hole on the dorsal aspect
of the wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. My memory is that the wound in the thigh through the skin was
about the same as the mound on the skin of the dorsum of the wrist, but I didn't
make an accurate observation at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would your thinking on that be affected any if I informed you
that Dr. Shires was of the view and had the recollection that the wound on
the thigh was much larger than a hole accounted for by the size of fragments
which remained in the femur.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Of course, Dr. Shires actually treated and closed this wound, but
since this wound was made through the skin in a tangential <span class="locked">manner&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you are referring to the wound of the thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I am referring to the wound of the thigh&mdash;was made in a tangential
manner, it did not go in at a direct right angle, the slit in the skin in the
thigh could be considerably longer than the actual size of the missile itself,
because this is a sharp fragment that would make a cutting&mdash;it would cause a
laceration rather than a puncture wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, the hole in the thigh would be consistent with a very small
fragment in the femur?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, a moment ago I asked you what would be your opinion as
to the point of entry and the point of exit based solely on the appearances of the
holes on the dorsal and volar aspects of the wrist, and you responded that you
still thought, or that you did think that the volar aspect was the point of entry
with the additional thought that the missile might not have gone through the
wrist, but only a fraction having gone through the wrist&mdash;now, my question is in
giving that answer, did you consider at that time the hypothesis that the wound
on the wrist was caused by the same missile which went through the Governor's
chest, or was that answer solely in response to the characteristics of the wound
on the wrist alone?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I have always felt that the wounds of Governor Connally could be
explained by the passage of one missile through his chest, striking his wrist and
a fragment of it going on into his left thigh. I had never entertained the idea
that he had been struck by a second missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, focusing for just a minute on the limited question of the
physical characteristics of the wounds on the wrist, if you had that and nothing
more in this case to go on, what would your opinion be as to which point was
entry and which point was exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Ordinarily, we usually find the wound of entrance is smaller than the
wound of exit. In the Governor's wound on the wrist, however, if the wound
on the dorsum of the wrist is the wound of entrance, and this large missile passed
directly through his radius, I'm not clear as to why there was not a larger wound
of exit than there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mean on the volar aspect?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; if a whole bullet hit <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating the dorsal aspect?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; and came out through here, why it didn't carry more bone
out through the wrist than it did, and the bone was left in the wrist&mdash;the bone
did not come out. In other words, when it struck the fifth rib it made a hole
this big around (indicating) in the chest in carrying bone fragments out through
the chest wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Wouldn't that same question arise if it went through the volar
aspect and exited through the dorsal aspect?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. It wouldn't if you postulated that the bullet did not pass through
the wrist, but struck the wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would be present in either event, though, if you postulated
if the bullet struck the dorsal aspect of the wrist, and did not pass through, but
only a missile passed through the volar aspect.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; in that case, however, considering the wound of exit from the
chest, and if that same bullet went on through the wrist, I would still expect a
pretty good wound of entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You see, I am trying now, Dr. Shaw, to disassociate the thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
that this is the same missile, so that I'm trying to look at it just from the physical
characteristics of the appearance of the wounds on the two sides of the wrist.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. May we go off the record just a minute?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Sure&mdash;off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Shaw, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let us go back on the record and let the record reflect that we
have been discussing another aspect concerning Dr. Shaw's thought that if the
main missile had gone through the entire radius, that there would have been more
damage, presumably, to the arteries and tendons on the underside of the wrist,
and I then called Dr. Shaw's attention to one additional factor in Dr. Gregory's
testimony which is reflected in his report that "on the radial side of the arm,
small fine bits of cloth consistent with fine bits of mohair were found," which was
one of the reasons for Dr. Gregory's thinking that the path was from the dorsal
aspect to the volar aspect.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And Dr. Shaw's reply, if this is correct, Doctor, that you would
know of no readily available explanation for that factor in the situation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Except that it might have been carried by the small fragment
which obviously passed through the wrist and attached to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But could the fragment have carried it from the radial side on
it if it had been traveling from the volar side to the radial side?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; it could have carried it through and deposited it on the way
through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I see, so it might have started on the volar aspect and could
have gone on through.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. You know, if we could get that suit of his, it would help a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, we are going to examine clothing if at all possible.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Because, I think it would have been almost impossible&mdash;I think
if you examine the clothing and if you had a hole here in his coat and no hole
on this <span class="locked">side&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Indicating a hole on the femur <span class="locked">side&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. That would almost clear that thing up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; it would be very informational in our analysis of the
situation.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I doubt if there is a hole in both sides of the sleeve&mdash;the sleeve
wouldn't be quite that long, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shaw, my next question involves whether you have ever
had a conversation with Governor Connally about the sequence of events of
the day he was shot?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes, we have talked on more than one occasion about this. The
Governor admits that certain aspects of the whole incident are a bit hazy.
He remembers hearing a shot. He recognized it as a rifle shot and turned to
the right to see whether President Kennedy had been injured. He recognized
that the President had been injured, but almost immediately, he stated, that
he felt a severe shock to his right chest. He immediately experienced some
difficulty in breathing, and as he stated to me, he thought that he had received
a mortal wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he tell you why he thought the wound was mortal?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. He just knew that he was badly hit, as he expressed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he comment on whether or not he heard a second shot
before he felt this wound in his chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. He says that he did not hear a second shot, but did hear&mdash;no,
wait a minute, I shouldn't say that. He heard only two shots so that he
doesn't know which shot other than the first one he did not hear. He only
remembers hearing two shots, his wife says distinctly she heard three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Connally said she heard three?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Mrs. Connally distinctly remembered three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, Governor Connally said he heard two shots?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Two shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that not be consistent with a situation where he was
hit by the second shot and lost consciousness?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; the shock of the wounding might have prevented him from
hearing the rifle report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you have expected him to hear a third shot after he was
wounded by a second shot?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. He didn't lose consciousness at that time, although he said he
did lose consciousness during a part of the trip from the point of wounding
to the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Governor Connally tell you whether or not he heard President
Kennedy say anything?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. He said that all he heard was the President say, "Oh," that's
the only thing he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mrs. Connally state whether or not she heard the President
say anything?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. My memory isn't good for that. I don't remember what Mrs.
Connally told me on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you continuing to treat Governor Connally at the present
time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes, although the treatment of the chest is practically at an end,
because the chest has reached a satisfactory state of healing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you continue to treat the Governor all during his stay
at Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes, I attended him several times daily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shaw, would you think it consistent with the facts that
you know as to Governor Connally's wounds that he could have been struck
by the same bullet which passed through President Kennedy, assuming that
a missile with the muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second, a 6.5-millimeter
bullet, passed through President Kennedy at a distance of 160 to 250 feet from
the rifle, passing through President Kennedy's body, entering on his back and
striking only soft tissue and exiting on his neck; could that missile have also
gone through Governor Connally's chest in your opinion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes, taking your description of the first wound sustained by the
President, which I, myself, did not observe, and considering the position of the
two men in the limousine, I think it would be perfectly possible for the first
bullet to have passed through the soft tissues of the neck of President Kennedy
and produced the wounds that we found on Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could that bullet then have produced all the wounds that you
found on Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes, I would still be postulating that Governor Connally was
struck by one missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as you sit here at the moment on your postulation that
Governor Connally was struck by one missile, is that in a way which is depicted
by diagram No. 5 on the exhibit heretofore marked as "Dr. Gregory's Exhibit
No. 1?"</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; I feel that the line of trajectory as marked on this diagram
is accurate as it could be placed from my memory of this wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, on that trajectory, how do you postulate the bullet then
passed through the wrist from dorsal to volar or from volar to dorsal?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. My postulation would be from volar to dorsal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, then, going back to diagram No. 1, Dr. Shaw, there is one
factor that we did not call your attention to or have you testify about, and that
is&mdash;the marking that the exit is on the volar side and the entry is on the
dorsal side as it was remarked by Dr. Gregory, that would then be inconsistent
of your view of the situation, would it not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes, it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And similarly on diagram No. 3, where the exit is marked on the
volar, and the entry is marked on the dorsal, that would also be inconsistent
with your view of the situation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes&mdash;he has the wound on the back being quite a bit larger than
the wound on the front here, doesn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, the wound as it appears here on the diagram is larger.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. That wasn't my memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But I don't think that that is necessarily as to scale in this
situation. Would it be possible from your knowledge of the facts here, Dr. Shaw,
that President Kennedy might have been struck by the bullet passing through
him, hitting nothing but soft tissues, and that bullet could have passed through
Governor Connally's chest and a second bullet might have struck Governor
Connally's wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; this is a perfectly tenable theory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, then, the damage to Governor Connally's thigh might have
come from either of the bullets which passed through the chest or a second
bullet which struck the wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. That is true&mdash;as far as the wounds are concerned, this theory,
I feel, is tenable. It doesn't conform to the description of the sequence of the
events as described by Mrs. Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what respect Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Well she feels that the Governor was only struck by one bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why does she feel that way; do you know, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. As soon as he was struck she pushed him to the bottom of the car
and got on top of him and it would mean that there would be a period of&mdash;well
if there were 5½ seconds between the three shots, there would be a couple
seconds there that would have given her time to get him down into the car,
and as she describes the sequence, it is hard to see how he could have been
struck by a second bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If she pushed him down immediately after he was shot on the
first occasion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But if her reaction was not that fast so that he was struck
twice, of course then there would be a different situation, depending entirely on
how fast she reacted.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I think if he had been struck first in the wrist and not struck in
the chest, he would have known that. He only remembers the hard blow to the
back of his chest and doesn't remember being struck in the wrist at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Might he not have been struck in the chest first and struck by
a subsequent shot in the wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; but that's hard to postulate if he was down in the bottom
of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shaw, have you been interviewed by any representatives of
the Federal Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who talked to you about this case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I don't have his name. I perhaps could find it. It was a member
of the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On how many occasions were you talked to by a Secret Service
man?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you tell him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I told him approximately the same that has been told in this
transcript.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And prior to the time we started to go on the record with the
court reporter taking this down verbatim, did you and I have a discussion
about the purpose of the deposition and the questions that I would ask you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were the answers which you provided me at that time the
same as those which you have testified to on the record here this afternoon?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any other written record of the operation on
Governor Connally other than that which has been identified here in Commission
Exhibit No. 392?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. No; this is a copy of the operative record that went on to the
chart of Governor Connally which is in the possession of the record room of
Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything else which you could tell us which you
think might be helpful to the Commission in any way, Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. No; I believe that we have covered all of the points that are
germane to this incident. Anything else that I would have would actually be
hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, sir, for appearing.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. All right, you are welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the witness, Dr. Shaw, off the
record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shaw, permit me to ask you one or two more questions. Did
you find any bullets in Governor Connally's body?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you find any fragments of bullets in his chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. No; only fragments of shattered rib.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you find, or do you know whether any fragment was
found in his wrist or the quantity of fragments in his wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. It is my understanding that only foreign material from the suit
of Governor Connally was found in the wrist, although in the X-ray of the
wrist there appeared to be some minute metallic fragments in the wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to the wound on the back of Governor Connally, was there
any indication that the bullet was tumbling prior to the time it struck him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. I would only have to say that I'm not a ballistics expert, but the
wound on his chest was not a single puncture wound, it was long enough so
that there might have been some tumbling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mean the wound on his back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. The wound on his back&mdash;yes, it was long enough so that there
might have been some tumbling. In other words, it was not a spherical puncture
wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So it might have had some tumbling involved, or it might not
have?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; I don't know whether the clothes would have occasioned
this or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. My question would be that perhaps some tumbling might have
been involved as a result of decrease in velocity as the bullet passed through
President Kennedy, whether there was any indication from the surface of the
wound which would indicate tumbling.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. The wound entrance was an elliptical wound. In other words,
it had a long diameter and a short diameter. It didn't have the appearance of
a wound caused by a high velocity bullet that had not struck anything else;
in other words, a puncture wound.</p>

<p>Now, you have to also take into consideration, however, whether the bullet
enters at a right angle or at a tangent. If it enters at a tangent there will be
some length to the wound of entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, would you say in net that there could have been some tumbling
occasioned by having it pass through another body or perhaps the oblique
character of entry might have been occasioned by the angle of entry.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Yes; either would have explained a wound of entry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine, thank you very much, Doctor.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shaw</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t95"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_CHARLES_FRANCIS_GREGORY" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_CHARLES_FRANCIS_GREGORY">TESTIMONY OF DR. CHARLES FRANCIS GREGORY</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Charles Francis Gregory was taken at 2:30 p.m., on
March 23, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen
Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that at the start of this session that I have
here at the moment Dr. Charles Gregory, who has appeared here in response to
a letter of request from the President's Commission on the Assassination of
President Kennedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
May I say to you, Dr. Gregory, that the purpose of the Commission is to investigate
all facets relating to the assassination, including the wounding of
President Kennedy, and the wounding of Governor Connally, and we have asked
you to appear here for the purpose of testifying concerning your treatment of
Governor Connally. Our rules specify that we make a brief statement of the
purpose of the Commission, and the purpose of our calling on you.</p>

<p>Now, will you stand up and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before the President's
Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Dr. Charles Francis Gregory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your profession, sir?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I am a physician and surgeon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline your educational background, please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I received a bachelor of science degree from Indiana University
in 1941, and a doctor of medicine in 1944. I have completed 5 years of
post-graduate training in orthopedic surgery at the Indiana University Medical
Center in 1951. I remained there excepting for an interlude with the U.S. Navy
in 1953 and 1954, until 1956. In 1956 I assumed my present position, which is
that of professor of orthopedic surgery and chairman of the division of orthopedic
surgery at the Southwestern Medical School, University of Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Gregory, are you certified by the American Board?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I am certified by the American Board of Orthopedic Surgery;
yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what year were you so certified?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In 1953. I am now a member of the American Board of Orthopedic
Surgery, as a matter of fact.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Gregory, what experience, if any, have you had in the
treatment of gunshot wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. My experience with the treatment of gunshot wounds began
with my training in orthopedic surgery, but its greatest impetus occurred in
1953 and 1954 in the Korean theatre of operations with the U.S. Navy. Since
that time here at the Parkland Hospital in Dallas our service has attended
a considerable number of such injuries, plus my experience is continuing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you approximate the total number of gunshot wounds
you have had experience with?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I have had personal experience with, I suppose, in approximately
500 such missile wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Gregory, back on November 22, 1963, did you have occasion
to treat Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your call
to treat the Governor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I had been seeing patients in the health service at the medical
school building on the morning of November 22 and was there when word was
received that the President had been shot. I did not then know that the
Governor had also been injured. I came to the emergency room of Parkland
Hospital and upon gaining entrance to it, inquired as to whether or not Mr.
Kennedy's wounds were of a nature that would require my assistance.</p>

<p>I was advised that they were not. I then took a number of persons from the
emergency room area with me away from it in order to reduce the confusion,
and I went to the orthopedic ward on the fifth floor west of Parkland Hospital.
After attending some of the patients on that ward, I was preparing to leave
the hospital and went by the operating room area to see whether or not I could
be of any other assistance, and was apprised then that a page was out for me.
At that time Dr. Shaw advised me that Governor Connally had been wounded
and that among his wounds were those to the right forearm and the left thigh.
He had asked that I stay and attend those wounds after he had completed care
of the Governor's chest wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time did you have that conversation
with Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. To the best of my knowledge, that conversation must have been
about between 1 and 1:15 in the afternoon of November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And that conversation was with Dr. Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Dr. Robert Shaw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what part did Dr. Robert Shaw have in the treatment of
Governor Connally in a general way?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, Dr. Robert Shaw attended the most serious wound that
the Governor sustained, which was one to his right chest, and it was his operation
which took precedence over all others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, was that operation completed before your operation
commenced?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; Dr. Shaw's operation had been completed before we even
arranged the Governor's right arm and left thigh for definitive care.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At approximately what time did your operation of Governor
Connally begin?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. My operation on Governor Connally began about 4 o'clock p.m.
on Friday, November 22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And approximately how long did it last?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The better part of an hour&mdash;I should judge&mdash;45 to 50 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who, if anyone, assisted you in that operation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I was assisted by the junior orthopedic resident, Dr. William
Osborne, and the orthopedic intern, Dr. John Parker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was Governor Connally's condition when you first saw
him with respect to his chest wounds, first, if you will, please tell us?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I did not see Governor Connally myself until he had been taken
into the operating room and had had an endotracheal tube placed in his larynx
and had been anesthetized. Having accomplished this, the very precarious
mechanics of respiration had been corrected and his general status at that time
was quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What observations did you have with respect to his wound in
the chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I had none, really, for the business of prepping and draping was
underway at that time, and I did not intrude other than to observe very casually,
and I don't remember any details of it.</p>

<p>Now, I did see in the course of the operation the wound in his chest, the
wound of entry, and its posterior surface and the wound of exit on the anterior
surface.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did the wound of entry look like, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. It appeared to me that the wound of entry was sort of a linear
wound, perhaps three-quarters of an inch in length with a rounded central portion.
Whereas, the wound of exit was rather larger than this, perhaps an
inch and a half across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at approximately what part of the body was the wound
that you described as the wound of entry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In view of the drapes that were on the Governor at the time,
I will have to speculate, but as I recall best, it was in an area probably 2 inches
below and medial to the right nipple.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the wound of entry or exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That's the wound of exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the wound of entry?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The wound of entry was too obscure for me to identify, since
it was just in general over the posterior aspect of his chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe with respect to the wound of his wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I didn't see the wound of his wrist until after the chest operation
had been completed, because his arm was covered by the operation drapes,
the surgical drapes for the chest procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you did have an opportunity to observe the wound
of the wrist, what did you then see?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I observed the wound on the dorsal aspect of his wrist, which
was about 2 cm. in length, ragged, somewhat irregular, and lay about an inch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
and a half or 2 inches above the wrist joint. It was a little to the radial side
of the wrist area.</p>

<p>There was a second wound in the wrist on the volar surface, about a centimeter
and a half proximal to the distal flexion crease and this wound was a transverse
laceration no more than a centimeter in length and did not gape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say on the dorsal aspect, what is that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In lay terms, that's equivalent to the back of the hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the volar is equivalent to what?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The palm surface of the hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What conclusion, if any, did you reach as to which was the
wound of entry and exit on the wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Based on certain findings in the wound at the time the debridement
was carried <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you define debridement before you proceed with that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; debridement is a surgical term used to designate that
procedure in attending a wound which removes by sharp excision all nonvital
tissue in the area together with any identifiable foreign objects.</p>

<p>In attending this wound, it was evident early that clot had been carried into
the wound from the dorsal surface to the bone and into the fracture. This
would imply that an irregular missile had passed through the wrist from the
dorsal to the volar aspect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, were there any characteristics in the volar aspect which
would indicate that it was a wound of exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; there were none, really. It was my assumption that the
missile had expended much of its remaining energy in passing through the
radius bone, which it did before it could emerge through the soft tissues.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any foreign objects identifiable as bits of fragments
or portions of a bullet missile?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. A preliminary X-ray had indicated that there were metallic
fragments or at least metallic fragments which cast metallic shadows in the
soft tissues around the wounded forearm. Two or three of these were identified
and were recovered and were observed to be metallic in consistency. These
were turned over to appropriate authorities for further disposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately how large were those fragments, Dr. Gregory?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I would judge that they were first&mdash;flat, rather thin, and that
their greatest dimension would probably not exceed one-eighth of an inch.
They were very small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you have sufficient experience with gunshot wounds to
comment as to whether a 6.5-mm. bullet could have passed through the Governor's
wrist in the way you have described, leaving the fragments which you
have described and still have virtually all the bullet missile intact, or having
158 grains of a bullet at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, I am not an expert on ballistics, but one cannot escape
certain ballistic implications in this business.</p>

<p>I would say, first of all, that how much of the missile remains intact as a
mass depends to some extent on how hard the metal is. Obviously, if it is very
soft, as lead, it may lose more fragments and therefore more weight and volume
than it might if it is made of a harder material or is jacketed in some way.</p>

<p>Now, the energy in the missile is a product, not so much of its mass as it is
of its velocity, for by doubling the velocity, you can increase the kinetic energy
in the force it transmits, fourfold, since the formula for determining energy in
these cases is a matter of mass times velocity squared, rather than just linear
functional velocity. So, some knowledge of how much of the cartridge force
might have been behind the missile would be useful here too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For the purpose of this consideration, I am interested to know
the the metal which you found in the wrist was of sufficient size so that
the bullet which passed through the wrist could not have emerged virtually
completely intact or with 158 grains intact, or whether the portions of the
metallic fragments were so small that that would be consistent with having
virtually the entire 6.5-mm. bullet emerge.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, considering the small volume of metal as seen by X-ray,
and the very small dimensions of the metal which was recovered, I think several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
such fragments could have been flaked off of a total missile mass without
reducing its volume greatly.</p>

<p>Now, just how much, depends of course upon what the original missile
weighed. In other words, on the basis of the metal left behind in Governor
Connally's body, as far as I could tell, the missile that struck it could be
virtually intact, insofar as mass was concerned, but probably was distorted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you have any idea at all as to what the fragments
which you observed in the Governor's wrist might weigh, Doctor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No, not really, but it would have been very small&mdash;very small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What treatment or action did you take with respect to treating
the Governor's wrist for him, Dr. Gregory?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Upon completing the debridement, we were then faced with a
decision as to whether we should suture his wound in the conventional manner
or not, and we chose not to, leaving the wound open in deference to potential
infection that might be produced by retained fragments of clothing. Having
decided upon that course of action, the fractured radius bone was then manipulated
into a reduced position and the entire limb was encased in a plaster-paris
cast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did that complete your operative procedure?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That completed my operative procedure for that day for Governor
Connally&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What other wounds, if any, did you notice on the Governor
at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In addition to the chest wound and the wound just described in
his right forearm there was a wound in the medical aspect of his left thigh.
This was almost round and did not seem to have disturbed the tissues badly,
but did definitely penetrate and pass through the skin and to the fascia beneath.
I could not tell from the superficial inspection whether it had passed through the
fascia. An X-ray was made of his thigh at that time and there was not present
in his thigh any missile of sufficient magnitude, in my opinion, to have produced
the wound observed on his medial aspect. Repeat X-rays failed to reveal
any such missile and an additional examination failed to reveal any wound of
exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did the X-rays reveal with respect to the presence of a
missile?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In the thigh there was a very small shadow, perhaps 1 mm.
by 2 mm. in dimension, lying close to the medial aspect of the femur, that is,
the thigh bone, but was in my opinion much too small to have accounted for the
dimensions of the wound on the medial aspect of his thigh or a wound of
that character.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the dimensions of the wound on the medial aspect
of his thigh.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I would say that that wound was about a centimeter in diameter,
much larger than the identifiable fragment of metal in the thigh. I might add
that this prompted some speculation on our part, my part, which was voiced to
someone that some search ought to be made in the Governor's clothing or perhaps
in the auto or some place, wherever he may have been, for the missile
which had produced this much damage but which was not resident in him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately what type of a missile would it have taken to
produce a wound which you have described on his thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, it would take a fragment of metal of approximately the
same diameter&mdash;a centimeter, and in general&mdash;round.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that correspond with the measurement of a 6.5-mm.
missile?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I will have to guess&mdash;I don't know what dimension&mdash;of a 6.5-mm.&mdash;yes,
a 6.5-mm. would be .65 cm., approximately, yes, that could have very
well have occurred from such a missile, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Gregory. I now show you two typewritten pages which are
a portion of a document identified as Commission Exhibit No. 392, which in
its total aspect constitutes all of the medical records from Parkland Hospital
on President Kennedy and Governor Connally and the two pages to which I
direct your attention relate an operation on Governor Connally, where you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
listed as the surgeon, and I ask you if you will take a minute and look those
over and tell us whether or not that is your report on the operation which you
have just been describing.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. (Examining instrument referred to.) Yes, this appears to
be the essence of the report which I dictated at the conclusion of my operation
on Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the facts contained in this report the same as those
to which you have testified here today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think they are&mdash;I hope so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you describe in a general way what treatment you
have given Governor Connally following the time when you completed this
report on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The Governor remained in Parkland Hospital for some 2 weeks
after his admission. On the 5th day after the operation, in the Governor's
hospital room, the wound on the dorsal surface of his wrist was closed by wire
sutures and this was carried out in the room. On the 10th day, I believe it
was, the 10th day from injury, the Governor was taken back to the operating
room and there under a light general anesthesia, his wounds were dressed and
inspected, and a new plaster of paris cast was applied at that time.</p>

<p>The Governor was then permitted up and about with his arm in a sling,
and shortly thereafter returned to the Governor's Mansion in Austin. I visited
Governor Connally in the Governor's Mansion in Austin about 1 week after his
discharge from the hospital, simply for check-up examination and I found things
to be in a satisfactory state.</p>

<p>I saw the Governor again about 1 month after his discharge, in the office
of Dr. Robert A. Dennison in Austin, Tex., and another examination this time,
including an X-ray, was made, and again the condition of his right forearm
and of the fractured bone were considered to be satisfactory.</p>

<p>Now, I've got to think of the next date&mdash;off of the record or on as you <span class="locked">wish&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, we will go off of the record, Doctor, while you are
thinking that through.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Specter and the Witness Gregory off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, Dr. Gregory.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I'll say on or about February 14, the Governor came to Dallas
and on that occasion we removed his cast, obtained an X-ray, found his fracture
to be healing satisfactorily, and so we applied a new cast. The Governor wore
that cast until 1 week ago, when he again came to Dallas. The cast was
removed, and X-ray revealed satisfactory healing of his fracture, and the cast,
as a continuous form of treatment, was discontinued.</p>

<p>At the present time the Governor is on a regiment of exercises, and he wears
a demountable splint, whenever it looks as though the electorate may be over
enthusiastic by shaking his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you anticipate any future cast for Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I anticipate probably an uneventful, though slow, recovery of
normal function in his right arm and wrist and hand.</p>

<p>I think he will have some permanent impairment, but I think he will have a
very minimal amount of disability, and I do not at this time anticipate any
need for any further surgical intervention. That will have to become manifest
by the appearance of some other as yet unanticipated symptom.</p>

<p>I would like to add that on each of the examination interviews here in Dallas,
the Governor was also checked over by Dr. Robert Shaw, from the point of
view of recovery from his chest wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Gregory, I now show you a series of diagrams which are
a part of reports bearing Commission No. 326 and may the record show these
differ from Commission Exhibit numbers, reflecting the number assigned to
reports.</p>

<p>I am going to ask the Court Reporter to mark this particular copy as Dr.
Gregory's Exhibit No. 1.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the Reporter as Dr. Gregory's Exhibit No. 1, for
identification.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I am going to ask you, pointing first to Diagram No. 1, whether
or not this accurately depicts the wounds of Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. This one does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what respect?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. In the respect that the wound of entry is shown to exist on
the volar surface of the forearm, whereas, it was on the dorsal surface of the
forearm in my view&mdash;in my opinion&mdash;and the reverse holds for the wound of
exit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you take my pen and correct those as they should be,
Doctor Gregory?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. (Complied with request of Counsel Specter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, turning to Exhibit, Diagram No. 2 on this exhibit, and
calling your attention specifically to the point of entry and the point of exit
on the diagram of a man standing, does that correspond with the angle of
declination on Governor Connally's wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. To the best of my knowledge, this would fairly accurately
depict that angle. If I were to have any reservation at all, it would be with
reference to the height or the position of the wounds of entry, as being marked
a little high, but this is recalling from memory, and it may not be correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now call your attention to Diagram No. 3 on this sequence
and ask if this accurately depicts the condition of the Governor's wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think that this one comes more closely into line with their
actual location, especially with reference to the wound of entry in the posterior
aspect of the chest. It is a little lower here, as I recall it to be. Those
of the wrist, I think are accurately depicted, and that of the thigh are believed
to be accurately depicted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And on these wrist wounds, do they show the point of entry
to be on the dorsal aspect and the point of exit to be on the volar aspect?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. According to the anatomical position, I believe that they do;
yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, looking at Diagram No. 4, does this again correspond with
your recollection of the angle of decline on Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Again, if I have a reservation it would be to the wound of
entry and the posterior aspect as being shown a little higher than it actually
existed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, Dr. Gregory, I turn to Diagram No. 5, which depicts a
seated man and what does Diagram No. 5 depict to your eye with respect to
what action is described on the seated man?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, I should say that this composite has alined the several
parts of the body demonstrated in such a way that a single missile following
a constant trajectory could have accounted for all of the wounds which are
shown.</p>

<p>Moreover, this is consistent with the point of entry which is depicted on the
side views showing the angle of declination. I submit that the angle of declination
in passing through the chest could be very simply altered by having an
individual lean forward a few degrees, and similarly could be made much deeper
by having him lean backward, without really changing the basic relationship
between the parts, nor in any way affecting the likelihood that all parts could
have come into this same trajectory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you consider it possible, in your professional opinion,
for the same bullet to have inflicted all of the wounds which you have described
on Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; I believe it very possible, for a number of reasons. One
of these&mdash;is the apparent loss of energy manifested at each of the various body
surfaces, which I transected, the greatest energy being at the point of entry
on the posterior aspect of the chest and of the fifth rib, where considerable
destruction was done and the least destruction having been done in the medial
aspect of the thigh where the bullet apparently expended itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What destruction was done on the fifth rib, Dr. Gregory?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. It is my understanding from conversations with Dr. Shaw, and
I believe his medical reports bear this out, that the fifth rib was literally shattered
by the missile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
We know that high velocity bullets striking bone have a strong tendency to
shatter bones and the degree to which the fifth rib was shattered was considerably
in excess of the amount of shattering which occurred in the radius&mdash;the
forearm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what conclusion, if any, did you draw as to the velocity of
the missile, as to the time it struck each of those bony portions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I think that the missile was continually losing velocity with
each set of tissues which it encountered and transected, and the amount of
damage done is progressively less from first entrance in the thorax to the last
entrance in the thigh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think it possible that Governor Connally was shot by two
bullets, with one hitting in the posterior part of his body and the second one
striking the back side of his wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. The possibility exists, but I would discount it for these reasons&mdash;ordinarily,
a missile in flight&mdash;I'll qualify that&mdash;a high velocity missile in flight
does not tend to carry organic material into the wound which it creates.</p>

<p>I believe if you will inspect the record which was prepared by Dr. Shaw,
there is no indication that any clothing or other organic material was found in
the chest wound.</p>

<p>An irregular missile can carry debris into a wound and such debris was
carried into the wound of the wrist.</p>

<p>I would have expected that an undistorted high velocity missile striking the
wrist would not have carried material into it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other characteristic which led and leads you
to conclude that the wrist was not the initial point of impact of a single high
velocity bullet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes. Based on our experience with high velocity missile wounds
of the forearm produced by rifles of the deer hunting calibre, there is tremendous
soft tissue destruction as well as bone fragmentation which not infrequently
culminates in amputation of the part.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the missile wound in Governor Connally's right forearm
was produced by a missile of such magnitude at the time it struck him. It
either had to be one of lower initial energy or a missile which had been partially
expended elsewhere before it struck his wrist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that opinion apply if you assumed that the missile had
initial velocity when leaving the muzzle of the weapon of 200 feet per second?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. That's not a very high velocity missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Pardon me&mdash;2,000 feet per second.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I should say that a missile at 2,000 feet per second that strikes
the forearm is likely to blow it very nearly off, if it is a missile of any mass as
well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, assume that you have a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per
second and assume the mass is 6.5 mm., and assume further that the distance
between the muzzle and the wrist is approximately 160 to 250 feet away, what
would you expect, based on your experience, that the consequences would be
on that wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I will have to say that most of the high velocity rifle wounds
that I have seen of the forearm have, in fact, been at a closer range than that
which you have stipulated, but I doubt that a range of 155 or 200 feet would
seriously reduce the energy, and I would expect a similar wound, under the
circumstances which you have described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let me add another possibility in this sequence, Dr. Gregory, and
ask you your opinion with respect to an additional intervening victim in the
path of the same bullet to this effect&mdash;assume that President Kennedy was riding
in an open automobile directly behind Governor Connally, and that at a distance
of approximately 175 feet President Kennedy was struck by a bullet from a
weapon with a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second, carrying a 6.5 mm.
missile and that the missile entered in the upper right of the President's back
very near the neckline and passed through his body, striking no bony material,
and emerged from the throat of the President. Is it possible that missile could
have then entered the back of the Governor and inflicted the chest wound which
you have described?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I would have to concede that that would be possible&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would your professional opinion be, if you can formulate
one, as to whether or not that actually did happen in this situation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I really couldn't formulate an objective opinion about it. Only,
for this reason, that it would then become a question simply of trajectories, and
lining the two bodies up in such a way that this sequence of events could have
occurred. I would hazard one guess, that is, that had the missile that struck
Governor Connally passed through President Kennedy first, that though the
missile would not have been distorted necessarily, it would very probably have
begun to tumble. Now, if you like, I will define that for you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you please?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. A tumbling is a second&mdash;it actually is a third component of
motion that a missile may go through in its trajectory. First, there is a linear
motion from muzzle to target on point of impact. In order to keep a missile
on its path, there is imparted to it a rotary motion so that it is spinning. Now,
both of these are commensurate with the constant trajectory. A third component,
which is tumbling, and is literally the end over end motion, which may be
imparted to a missile should it strike something in flight that deflects but does
not stop it&mdash;in this circumstance the wound of entry created by such a missile
usually is quite large and the destruction it creates is increased, as a matter
of fact, by such tumbling, and I would have therefore expected to see perhaps
some organic material carried into a large wound of entry in Governor Connally's
back.</p>

<p>These are only theoretical observations, but these are some of the reasons
why I would believe that the missile in the Governor behaved as though it had
never struck anything except him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe the nature of the wound in the Governor's
back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Only so far as I saw it as Dr. Shaw was preparing to operate
on it, but I was unable to see the nature of the wound as he carried out his
operation. I did, however, specifically question him about this matter of
containing foreign material, clothing, etc.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did he say about that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Well, as I recall it, he said none was found, and I would not
have expected any to be found as I explained to you, if this was the initial
impact of that missile.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, wouldn't you think it possible, bearing in mind that my
last question only went as to whether the same bullet could have gone through
President Kennedy and inflicted the wound on Governor Connolly's chest,
would you think it possible that the same missile could have gone through
President Kennedy in the way I described and have inflicted all three of the
wounds, that is, the entry and exit on the chest, the entry and exit on the
wrist, and the entry into the thigh which you described.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. I suspect it's possible, but I would say it would have to be a
remarkably powerful missile to have done so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Gregory, have you been interviewed about this matter prior
to today by any representative of the Federal Government?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes; on two or three occasions I have talked to a properly
identified member of the Secret Service, Mr. Warren, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the nature of the information which you gave
to Mr. Warren on those occasions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Essentially the same thing as I have told you here, but in much
less detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you ever talked to anyone besides Mr. Warren and
me about these matters, from the Federal Government?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; not that I know of. I was on a day or so after the assassination
spoken to in these offices by a member of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
but it was a very brief interview.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was that about?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. And I think it was the question of whether or not I had been
able to recover any metal from Governor Connally which they might use for
ballistic analysis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
I regret to say I don't know the gentleman's name, but he too was properly
identified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And prior to the time when the Court Reporter started to
transcribe the deposition which you have been kind enough to provide us with,
had you and I been talking about the same subjects which you have answered
questions on all during the course of this deposition?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And during the time that you first were interviewed by the
Secret Service down through the present moment, have you had the same
general opinion concerning the matters which you have testified about here
today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add which you think would be helpful
in any way to the work of the Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. No; not really. This is the only articulation I have had with
this whole episode concerning Governor Connally's wound and his subsequent
recovery and none other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. Gregory, for coming.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Gregory</span>. Very well.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t104"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_GEORGE_T_SHIRES" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DR_GEORGE_T_SHIRES">TESTIMONY OF DR. GEORGE T. SHIRES</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Dr. George T. Shires was taken at 4:35 p.m., on March 23,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let the record show that as we are reconvening this session and
about to commence the deposition of Dr. George T. Shires, that the preliminary
statement is being made that this is pursuant to the investigation being
conducted by the President's Commission on the Assassination of President
Kennedy to determine all the facts relating to the shooting, including the
treatment rendered to Governor Connally as well as President Kennedy, and

Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Subsequently, Clinical Instructor in Surgery, University of
Texas, Southwestern Medical School, progressing through Assistant Professor
of Surgery, Associate Professor of Surgery, Professor of Surgery, and Chairman
of the Department of Surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your year of graduation from college, Dr. Shires?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. This was premedical, and at that time the war was on, so it
was a premedical 3 years&mdash;it was 1944.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what year did you receive your medical degree?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you Board certified at the present time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, in what year were you so certified?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I was certified by the American Board of Surgery in 1956.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to render any medical treatment for
President Kennedy back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No; I was not in town at the time the shooting occurred. I was
in Galveston, Tex., at the meeting of the Western Surgical Association.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to render medical attention and services
to Governor Connally, Dr. Shires?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state briefly the circumstances under which you were
called into this case?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. After the President and the Governor were brought to Parkland
Hospital, it was determined&mdash;well&mdash;all aid was given to the President that
was available, and it was determined that Governor Connally's injuries were
multiple, the primary injury to Governor Connally was to the chest.</p>

<p>Dr. Shaw, who is the professor of surgery&mdash;I don't need to tell their titles&mdash;you
will have all that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes&mdash;correct.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Dr. Shaw ascertained the condition of Governor Connally, instituted
therapy, and had the hospital notify me in Galveston of the status of the
President and also the Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to return then to Dallas in time to assist in
the operative procedures on Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at approximately what time did you return to Dallas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Approximately 3 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what participation did you have in the operative procedures
on Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. At the time I returned, the chest procedure was in progress.
The orthopedic procedure on the arm and the leg debridement were ready to be
started. I scrubbed and performed the leg procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe, if anything, as to the condition of Governor
Connally's chest wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. At the time I arrived, the chest wound had been debrided and
was being closed. His general condition at that point was very good. He
was receiving blood and the arm and leg wounds were being prepared for
surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any opportunity to observe the wound on his
back?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any opportunity to observe a wound on his chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Once again, not at that time&mdash;later, but not at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, what did you observe at a later time concerning the wound
on his back and on his chest?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Well, in part of his postoperative care, which was a large part
of the treatment, we were concerned, of course, with all the wounds, and he had
several chest wounds. These, at the time I saw them, had been debrided and
were the site of draining, so that their initial appearance was completely altered
by having had surgical debridement, so they were clean postsurgical wounds
with drainage, at the time I first saw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would their alteration and condition preclude you from giving
an opinion as to whether they were points of entry or points of exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. They would&mdash;really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe at the time you arrived at the hospital
as to the condition of his wrist, if anything?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. At that point his wrist was being prepared for surgery, and
although I did not examine this in detail, since I was concerned with the thigh
wound, there appeared to be a through and through wound of the wrist which
looked like a missile wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you able to formulate any opinion as to the point of entry
or the point of exit?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No; since I didn't examine it in detail; no, not really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you observe as to the wound on the thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. The wound on the thigh was a peculiar one. There was a 1 cm.
puncate missile wound over the junction of the middle and lower third of the leg
and the medial aspect of the thigh. The peculiarity came in that the X-rays of
the left leg showed only a very small 1 mm. bullet fragment imbedded in the
femur of the left leg. Upon exploration of this wound, the other peculiarity
was that there was very little soft tissue damage, less than one would expect
from an entrance wound of a centimeter in diameter, which was seen on the
skin. So, it appeared, therefore, that the skin wound was either a tangential
wound or that a larger fragment had penetrated or stopped in the skin and had
subsequently fallen out of the entrance wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What size fragment was there in the Governor's leg at that
time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. We recovered none. The small one that was seen was on X-ray
and it was still in the femur and being that small, with no tissue damage after
the debridement, it was thought inadvisable to remove this small fragment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that fragment in the bone itself at the present time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What would your best estimate be as to the size of that fragment?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. One millimeter in diameter&mdash;one to two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you have any estimate as to how much that might weigh
in grains?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. In grains&mdash;a fraction of a grain, maybe, a tenth of a grain&mdash;very
small.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A tenth of one grain?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What size bullet would it take to create the punctate hole which
you described in the thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. This would depend entirely on the angle and the speed and
weight of the bullet. For example, a small missile on a tangent may create a
surprisingly large defect. A large bullet with fast or a relatively slow velocity
will create the same defect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What operative procedures did you employ?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Progressive debridement from skin, fat, fascia, muscle, irrigation,
and through and through enclosure with stainless steel alloy wire and removable
sutures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does that complete a general description of what you did to
Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. In the operating room, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately what time did that operation start?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Approximately 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The operation that you were concerned with?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Oh, the operation that I was concerned with must have started at
3:30 or 4 o'clock, I guess it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And about what time did it end?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. My portion of it&mdash;about 20 minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who, if anyone, assisted you in that portion of the operation?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Doctors Robert McClelland, Charles Baxter, and Ralph Don
Patman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shires, I am showing you a document identified heretofore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
as Commission Exhibit No. 392, which is the report of Parkland Hospital on
the treatment of President Kennedy and Governor Connally, and I show you a
Parkland Memorial Hospital operative record, dated November 22, 1963, which
lists you as the surgeon, and ask you whether or not this represents the report
made by you on the operative procedures on Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes; it does.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, are those the same as the matters which you have heretofore
described during the course of this deposition as to what you did?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what treatment, if any, have you performed on Governor
Connally subsequent to November 22?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. A tremendous amount&mdash;postoperative care was of the essence
here in that he had multiple injuries, massive blood and fluid replacement, so
that to describe the care is really a detail of postoperative&mdash;I don't know how
much of this you want&mdash;in other words, he had clotting defects&mdash;I don't know
whether you want to take this down&mdash;I just want to ask you how much detail
you would like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Start off with a general description&mdash;perhaps, I will direct your
attention to some specific areas to abbreviate it.</p>

<p>First of all, how frequently did you see him after November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. For the first several days I saw him approximately every 2 to 4
hours for an hour or so each visit, and many times for 6 and 8 hours at a stretch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And after that time how frequently did you see him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Decreasing frequency over the next 3 weeks&mdash;never less than
three or four times a day, even after he was convalescing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long was he in the hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I don't really know the number of days he was in the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After he left the hospital, have you seen him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes; I saw him again approximately 2 weeks, I guess it was,
after he left the hospital, in Austin. He developed a superficial saphenous
thrombophlebitis in the right leg, not the one that the injury occurred in. This
was undoubtedly incident to a catheter cutdown having been placed in this leg
for administration of blood and fluids while he was in the hospital. He unequivocably
had a clot in the saphenous vein and at this time was placed on bed
rest, antibiotics, anticoagulants and responded very satisfactorily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you anticipate seeing him in the future?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Do I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Not for his wounds. No&mdash;the only followup care that he really
requires at the moment is the bone&mdash;the orthopedic followup, which incidentally
is also completely healed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Doctor, look, if you will, at a document which we have marked
Dr. Gregory X-1, used in the course of the deposition of Dr. Gregory, which
immediately preceded yours and directing your attention first to Diagram
Number 1, would the entry and exit holes on Governor Connally's back and
chest, being entry and exit, respectively, and the exit and entry on the wrist
with the entry being on the back side of the wrist and the exit on the front
side of the wrist, correspond with your observations of Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes; they would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, going to Diagram 2, which depicts a man standing, would
that correspond to the angle of the entry and exit wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, going to Diagram No. 3, would that diagram correspond
with the wounds on Governor Connally as you recollect them to be?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Going now to Diagram 4, would that again correspond with
the wounds on Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And as to Diagram No. 5, what does that represent?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. This, at the time of the discussion of Governor Connally's injuries
with his wife, before he really regained consciousness from surgery, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
apparent position that he was in in the car, which would explain one missile
producing all three wounds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have a discussion with Mrs. Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes; with Mrs. Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when was that discussion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Right after the surgery&mdash;this was the 22d, late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, if anything, did she tell you as to the Governor's
position?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. She had thought, and I think correctly so, that he had turned
to his right after he heard the first shot, apparently, to see what had happened
to the President, and he then later confirmed this, that he heard the first shot,
turned to his right, and then was hit.</p>

<p>I forgot about that a moment ago, incidentally. He definitely remembers
turning after hearing the first shot, before he was struck with a bullet. I forgot
about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did Governor Connally tell you that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Oh, several days later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. While he was in the hospital?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Oh, yes&mdash;4 or 5 days later and we were constructing the events.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the occasion for your conversation with him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. In part of his routine care one morning, as he was reconstructing
his memory of events, because his memory was quite hazy, since he had a
sucking wound of the chest and came in here relatively in anoxia, he had some
cyanosis, as you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is cyanosis?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Not enough oxygen of the tissues and this means they turn blue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that affect his memory?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes; sure would and did, and he remembers very little after he
fell over in the car&mdash;he is very hazy, until, oh, probably the second day post-operatively.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that affect his memory as to what happened before the
wound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or, would that affect only his memory while he was suffering
from lack of oxygen?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Probably just while he was suffering from lack of oxygen. He
didn't have that much hypoxia. Hypoxia or anoxia or lack of oxygen could affect
his memory. Had this been severe, this could have affected his memory for
preceding events, but his hypoxia fortunately did not last that long, and he
never showed real evidence of brain damage from the anoxia, so that I think
his memory for events up until the time he recalls falling over in the car
is probably accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you relate just as exactly as you can for us what he
said to you, and the nature of the conversation, with your replies, and how it
went as closely as you can recount it now?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. He recounted, and as I remember this particular occasion, Mrs.
Connally was in the room too, and reconstructing events, she related the story
of her last conversation with the President, relating to him, that the reception
had been warm and that she was glad he couldn't say that people of Texas
and in Dallas didn't like him and admire him, and she was very pleased with
the way things had gone the whole visit. Then, the next event that occurred
was that she remembers hearing a shot, he remembered hearing a shot&mdash;he
remembers turning to the right, he remembered being struck by a bullet, and
his next thought as he fell over toward his wife was "They're going to kill all
of us," and that's the last really clear memory that he expressed to me until
he remembers vaguely being in the emergency room, but very little of that,
and then he remembers waking up in the recovery room several hours later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything to you about who he meant by "they"?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. He didn't say&mdash;he didn't comment on it at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he describe the nature of the sound which he heard?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I don't believe he did&mdash;no.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did anybody describe the nature of the sound?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I think Mrs. Connally did. I think she thought it was, if I'm
not wrong, she thought it was a loud retort, either a gun or a firecracker. I
think she thought it was a bullet and I think he did too&mdash;thought it was a
gun&mdash;I believe he did too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did Governor Connally say anything about hearing President
Kennedy say anything?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No&mdash;no, he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Mrs. Connally say anything about whether President Kennedy
said anything?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No, she didn't. She remembered Mrs. Kennedy saying some
things, but she didn't remember anything about the President having uttered
a word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did Mrs. Kennedy say, according to Mrs. Connally?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Oh, it's vague, even in my memory, but things to the effect that
her husband had been shot and&mdash;well, that was really the essence of it. It
wasn't phrased that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Focusing on the time sequence&mdash;what did Governor Connally
say as to the timing, number one, the time he was hit, and number two, the
time he had heard a sound, and number three, the time he turned&mdash;those three
factors? In what sequence did he relate them?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. As he recalled it, he heard a shot, he turned to the right and felt
himself receiving a shot&mdash;in that order&mdash;in a matter of a few seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did he feel himself receive a shot?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. In the right chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he make any comment about feeling anything in his wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No; I don't believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about feeling anything in his thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I don't believe he ever commented on that to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he say anything else to you at that time about his recollections
on the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No; other than this striking feeling he had after he was hit,
that someone was trying to kill all of them&mdash;apparently he remembers that
quite clearly, right after he was hit, but that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you discuss his recollection of the events of the assassination
day with Governor Connally on any other occasion?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Oh, yes; sporadically, during his convalescence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else did he say to you at any other time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. He was just simply asking questions about things that happened
to him in the Emergency Room, in the Operating Room, and he was a little surprised
that he didn't recall them better, but this was after he was wounded
in here, but that was really the main thing&mdash;he was surprised that he didn't
remember some of the things&mdash;like the cutdowns for blood and that sort of
thing that were done to him, and, of course, this is obviously because he was
so anoxic at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he ever describe anything in more detail in his recollection
of the things on the day of the assassination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, going back to the first conversation you had with Mrs.
Connally on November 22d, did she say anything more to you other than that
which you have already testified about?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No&mdash;those were mainly the remarks that she made. I don't
remember any others, except&mdash;well, no&mdash;most of the others were&mdash;we were
discussing the Governor's condition and outlook and chances for recovery and
that sort of thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, looking again at Diagram No. 5, what is your professional
opinion, if you have one, as to whether Governor Connally's chest injury,
wrist injury, and thigh injury were caused by the same bullet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Well we all thought, me included, that this was probably one
missile, one bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "we all thought," whom do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Dr. Shaw, Dr. Gregory&mdash;as we were reconstructing the events<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
in the operating room in an attempt to plot out trajectory as best we could,
this appeared to be our opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did any of your assistants consult with you in those calculations?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I guess nearly all of them we have listed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. McClelland, Dr. Baxter and Dr. Patman?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about Dr. Osborne and Dr. Parker?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. They were working with Dr. Gregory. If they discussed it,
I'm sure they did&mdash;it was before I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about Dr. Boland and Dr. Duke who worked with Dr.
Shaw?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Now, again, I talked to them and they were discussing it as they
did the chest procedure, and again thought the same thing. Everyone was
under the impression this was one missile&mdash;through and through the chest,
through and through the arm and the thigh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any one of the doctors on either of these three teams
who had a different point of view?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think it is possible that Governor Connally could have
been struck by two bullets, one entering his back and emerging from his chest
and the second going into his wrist?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I'm sure it is possible, because missile sites are so variable,
depending upon the size of the bullet, the speed at which it travels, whether
it was tumbling or not. We have seen all kinds of combinations of entrance
and exit wounds and it's just impossible to state with any certainty, looking at
a given wound, what the nature of the missile was, so I am sure it is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think it is possible that, assuming a missile being a
bullet 6.5 mm. with a velocity of over 2,000 feet per second, and the distance
between the weapon and the victim being approximately 160 to 250 feet, that
the same bullet might have passed through President Kennedy, entering his
back near the midline and emerging from his neck, and then entering Governor
Connally in the back and emerging from his chest, into his wrist, through his
wrist and into the thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I assume that it would be possible. The main thing that would
make me think that this was not the case in that he remembers so distinctly
hearing a shot and having turned prior to the time he was hit, and in the
position he must have been, particularly here in Figure 5, I think it's obvious
that he did turn rather sharply to the right and this would make me think
that it was a second shot, but this is purely conjecture, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, is there anything, aside from what he told you, that is,
anything in the characteristics of the wounds on President Kennedy and the
wounds on Governor Connally which would lead you to conclude that it was
not the same bullet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No&mdash;there is nothing. It could have been&mdash;purely from the
standpoint of the wounds, it is possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You referred just a minute ago to his turning position?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is the postulation of a turning by Governor Connally necessary
to explain the point of entry in the back, exit in the chest, entry in the wrist,
and exit in the wrist, and entry into the thigh, in order to have that line&mdash;to
state it differently, is it necessary to postulate turning by the Governor?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Depending upon the angle of the trajectory&mdash;I suppose not. I
don't know what the angle of the trajectory was from where the bullet was
fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Assuming an angle of declination of approximately 45 degrees?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. This, I don't know without drawing it out, but as long as his
right arm is drawn in front of him next to the exit wound on the chest, he is
in a sitting position, if the angle of declination was right, then I think he
could have received this facing straight forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, on the wrist, would that be palm of the wrist, back of
the wrist, or how?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I don't understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what position would the wrist have had to be in, in order
to have the same bullet make all three wounds?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. The main point was that his arm be up here. In other words,
in some fashion, however his hand happened to be turned, but he had to have
his right arm raised up, next to his chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. His wrist would have to be up with the palm down, would it
not?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. As depicted here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In order for the point of entry to be on the dorsal side?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. That's right, again, which makes it a little more likely he was
turning, since ordinarily you pronate your wrist as you turn, whereas, this
would have been a little strange for him to have been sitting like this, but
again, depending on what he had in his hand. It's just a question of which
side is up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But it would be more natural, you say, for the palm to be down
in the turning, which was as contrasted with a relaxed sitting position where
it would be more likely his palm would be facing in towards his chest area?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any knowledge as to the damage which was done to
the rib?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Only from hearsay from Dr. Shaw, that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have any knowledge as to what fragments there were
in the chest, bullet fragments, if any?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No, again except from postoperative X-rays, there is a small
fragment remaining, but the initial fragments I think Dr. Shaw saw before I
arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about the fragments in the wrist, do you have any knowledge
of that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Again, there were small fragments which I saw during the procedure
on the wrist, but I was not directly involved in that procedure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What opinion do you have, if any, Dr. Shires, as to whether
the wound in the thigh might have been inflicted from a missile that did not
pass through any other part of the Governor's body, assuming that it was a 6.5-mm.
bullet with a muzzle velocity of 2,000 feet per second, traveling approximately
160 to 250 feet between the end of the weapon and the point of impact on
the thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Well, again, in that wound&mdash;it was strange in that the hole in
the skin was too large for the amount of damage inflicted on the underlying
tissues, so that had this been the case, this would have had to have been a
tangential wound. Had it been a tangential wound, then it's possible that small
fragments could have gone into bone as it did and that the damage to the
soft tissues was done only by that small fragment, so that the major portion
of the bullet simply hit the skin in a tangent and went on in its course
elsewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, is it possible that the bullet could have hit Governor
Connally with the thigh being the initial point of impact and do the damage
which was done there with the high velocity missile that I have just described
for you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Is it possible to get a wound like that?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes; as long as it's on a tangent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it likely to receive a wound like that from a high velocity
weapon of 2,000 feet per second and at about 160 to 250 feet?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. If it's a tangential wound, tangential wounds can be very strange.
A large bullet can cause a small hole if its on a tangent or a small bullet
can rip out a fairly large hole on a tangent. It just depends on the time of
contact and the angle of contact with the skin. That's why it's awfully hard
to predict.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that wound could have either been the first striking of the
Governor from the bullet, or it could have been from a missile whose velocity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
was spent after going through President Kennedy and through the Governor's
body and wrist and then caused that wound in the thigh?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. That's right, if it was a tangential bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dr. Shires, have you ever been contacted by any representative
of the Federal Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was it who contacted you?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. I don't recall the name&mdash;it was two individuals from the Secret
Service. They presented their credentials at the time to the administration
and then subsequently to me and they were given copies of our operative reports,
statements made by people concerned with the President and Governor
at the time, and then subsequently one of those same two men from Secret
Service returned and charted the entrance and exit wounds which you have
described previously, or we have looked at previously in these five diagrams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever been interviewed by any other representative
of the Federal Government before today?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No; not in person. I discussed over the phone with the FBI&mdash;well,
that was with regard to Oswald. I discussed over the phone what happened
to the bullet that was taken from Oswald, but not with regard to the
President or the Governor&mdash;no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On your prior interviews by the Secret Service, sir, did they
cover the same subjects which you and I have gone over today, or were other
subjects covered?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No; essentially the same subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was any different information given to you by the Secret
Service at that time of either of those two occasions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No; the same as we have discussed here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, prior to the time when you were sworn in and the court
reporter started to take the deposition in shorthand form, did you and I have
a brief discussion about the purpose of the deposition and the subject matters
of interest to the Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the same information given by you to me during the
course of that informal discussion as you have testified to on the record here
this afternoon?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes; in less detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you have anything which you would care to add which
you think might be helpful to the Commission in its work?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, fine, that concludes the deposition, thank you very much,
Dr. Shires.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Are you interested in Oswald&mdash;that's my only other question?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, let's talk about it a little off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between Counsel Specter and witness Dr. Shires off the record
at this point.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let's go back on the record. Dr. Shires, before concluding the
deposition, permit me to ask you just a few additional questions about care for
Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>

<p>First of all, I again show you Commission exhibit No. 392, the last two pages
which purport to be an operative record of Parkland Memorial Hospital on
November 24, 1963, concerning treatment of Mr. Oswald, with you listed as the
surgeon, and I'll ask you to take a look at these two sheets and tell us whether
or not that is a report which you prepared on treatment of Mr. Oswald?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline in a very general way what his condition was
when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. When he was first seen in the emergency room, he was unconscious,
without blood pressure or pulse, but with an audible heart beat, and
attempts, feeble though they were, attempts in respiration. There was an entrance
wound over the left lower chest and the bullet could be felt subcutaneously
over the lower chest lateral projecting this trajectory through the body and looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
at his general condition, it was fairly obvious that the bullet had transgressed
virtually every major organ and vessel in the abdominal cavity, which
later proved to be the case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do for him?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. He was given resuscitation, including an endotracheal tube,
intravenous fluids, blood, moved to the operating room, prepared, draped, an
abdominal incision, laparotomy made, just as is described in the record. The
injuries were in fact mortal and involved both major vessels in the abdomen,
the aorta, the inferior vena cava, and there had been massive exanguinating
hemorrhage into the abdomen&mdash;in and around the abdomen.</p>

<p>After securing control of all the many, many bleeding points and the bleeding
organs, he never had regained consciousness. Approximately 15, 16&mdash;whatever
it is, approximately, pints of blood had been given, and he had suffered
irreparable anoxia from the initial massive blood loss incident to the
gunshot wound. When his heart did stop, even though we felt this was a terminal
cessation of heartbeat, efforts were made at resuscitation by open heart
massage and all that went with it, but never once was an effective heartbeat
obtained, so that our initial impression was that it was correct in that this was
simply cardiac death and not cardiac arrest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you come close to saving him, in the vernacular&mdash;in lay
terms?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. There has never been recorded in medical literature recovery
from a wound like this. There was too much blood lost too fast. Had the injury
occurred right outside the operating room, it might have been possible to
reduce the period of anoxia that comes from overwhelming blood loss like
this, sufficiently to have corrected it. We did control all the bleeding points
with a lot of difficulty, finally all bleeding points were controlled and this was
a mortal wound&mdash;there was no question about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are the details of your observations, examination, and treatment
of Mr. Oswald set forth in the two pages of this report which I have
just shown you in Commission No. 392?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Yes, the operative reports that are contained there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Dr. Shires.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Shires</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Dr. Richard Brooks Dulany was taken at 6:20 p.m., on
March 25, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen
Specter, assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Dr. Richard Dulany is present in
response to the request that he appear to have his deposition taken and he has
been requested to appear here because he has been identified in prior depositions
as perhaps being one of the first doctors to see President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Dr. Dulany, have you had an opportunity to examine the Executive Order
creating the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the rules and regulations relating to the taking of
testimony?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you willing to have your deposition taken here today, even
though you haven't had the 3 days' notice which you have a right to, if you
want it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are willing to waive that requirement?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you stand up now and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the President's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Richard Brooks Dulany.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your profession?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. M.D.&mdash;Medical Doctor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you licensed to practice medicine in the State of Texas?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you outline your educational background, please,
starting with college&mdash;graduation from college?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. From college I went to the University Medical School of Oklahoma
and then took my internship here at Parkland Hospital and was in the
service for 2 years in the Navy, and I just got back from the service in
November, and started a residency here in surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to participate in the care of President
Kennedy on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Is this all recorded now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Well, as I stated, I principally cared for the Governor and
then after his emergency treatment had been cared for, I went into the room
where President Kennedy was being cared for.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present from the start of the Governor's treatment?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And about what time did you go into the room where the
President was being treated?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Well, I believe the Governor was supposed to have been in
the surgery suite upstairs within 12 minutes after he came in, and so I'm sure
I must have been in the room where the President was, about 7 minutes or so
afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time was that, about, as best you can place it?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. I don't really recollect the specific times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe as to the condition of the President when
you entered?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Well, at this time his pupils were fixed and dilated and he
had a large head wound&mdash;that was the first thing I noticed.</p>

<p>There was already a tracheotomy tube in the neck wound or what was later
described as a wound, and had a cutdown running and several other doctors were
putting chest tubes in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors were present at that time?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. I really can't be accurate on that. I remember Dr. Clark and
Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Giesecke, Dr. Carrico, Dr. Martin White, and of course,
the doctor that was probably down first of the staff members, Dr. Malcolm Perry,
and I remember Dr. McClelland, and Dr. Peters were in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are those all the doctors you remember as being down there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. I believe those are all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you identify any of the nurses who were there?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. No, I don't believe so. I can't remember them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there anything that you think that you know would be helpful
to the President's Commission in its inquiry into this matter?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. I don't believe I could add anything any more than you probably
already know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe any neck wound on the President?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The tracheotomy had already been performed?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. It had been placed in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had the incision already been made when you first saw the
President's neck?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. I really didn't examine it close enough to make any statement
along that line.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, did you observe any wound in the President's neck at all?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. No, I just know that the tracheotomy was in and later I was
told that this was a wound when it was first seen&mdash;you know, that's the best
I can tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's fine, Dr. Dulany, thank you very much for appearing
here today.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Dulany</span>. Yes; thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Ruth Jeanette Standridge was taken at 1:35 p.m., on March
21, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Miss Standridge, would you stand up and raise your right hand,

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, you may be seated.</p>

<p>Miss Standridge, the President's Commission is investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy and all the facts relating thereto, and we have asked you
to appear to have your deposition taken in connection with the treatment which
was given to Governor Connally in Parkland Memorial Hospital and to President
Kennedy in Parkland Memorial Hospital, and all facts relating to that.</p>

<p>Have you received a letter from the President's Commission requesting that
you appear?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, there was a letter came and I was out of town and
they opened it, the supervisor opened it and she had the letter, but I haven't
seen it yet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You haven't seen it yet?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, let me show you the enclosures which were in the letter
so that you may be familiar with them. Here is a copy of the White House
Executive order establishing the Commission, and here is a resolution establishing
the rules for taking testimony. Permit me to explain to you that the rules
require that we give you 3 days' notice, so that if you would request it now,
we could delay taking your deposition until sometime next week, if you would
prefer, or if you are agreeable to have us take your deposition, we can go right
ahead and take it now.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span> (reading instruments referred to). Thank you, you can
just go ahead if you want to&mdash;it's all right with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It doesn't make any difference to you whether it is today or
next week?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No; it does not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Ruth Jeanette Standridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your occupation or profession?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Head nurse of the emergency rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At what hospital?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Parkland Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your duties on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I was working as charge nurse in the major surgery area
in Parkland Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you receive notification that the President of the United
States was en route to Parkland Hospital?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes; by my supervisor, Doris Nelson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at about what time did you receive that notification?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. About 12:30, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action, if any, did you take as a result of getting that
notice?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Immediately went to trauma room 2 and I was in trauma
room 2 and began to set up Renger liquid and check the suction machine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was trauma room 1 set up?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Mrs. Nelson was setting trauma room 1 up at the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present when one or more of the victims arrived?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was it arrived?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Governor Connally was brought into trauma room 2 first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe President Kennedy arrive?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No; I was busy with the Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you do when the Governor arrived?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, we began to take his clothing off and the orderlies
continued that and the doctors and I started handing the syringe and medicine
and things necessary to start the IV.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, what do you mean by "IV"?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Intravenous fluids.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you assist in the taking off of Governor Connally's
clothes?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, did you notice with respect to the Governor's
shirt?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. There was blood on the front of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any bullet hole on the front of the shirt?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Not that I can say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. There could have been or could not have been, but you just
don't know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. There could have been, but mostly it was just blood that
we noticed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice anything on the coat?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. There was blood on the coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he wearing his suit coat?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice whether or not there was any bullet hole in
the coat?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I didn't see one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was Governor Connally's position when you first saw
him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. He was laying on his back on the cart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what kind of cart was he lying on?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. The emergency cart on rollers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is that emergency cart constructed of?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, it's just a thin fixture with rubber padding on the
top, and it is used to transfer the patients to the wards, and to X-ray and to
surgery.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it made of metal?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Of metal with four big tires on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With four roller tires on it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was on the cart underneath the Governor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, there was just a sheet was all we had on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anything on top of the Governor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, we put a sheet, when we unclothed him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he completely undressed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was he lying on top of that cart while he was being
undressed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who assisted you in the process of undressing him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, David Sanders was helping, he was my orderly that
was in the room, and also an aid, Rosa Majors, and she took the money out of
his pants, and Dr. Fueishier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. F-u-e-i-s-h-i-e-r (spelling), and Dr. Duke, and there was a
couple of other doctors&mdash;I don't remember who they were, but they were up
at the head, Dr. Fueishier and Dr. Duke, and Dr. Shaw came in before they
got the Governor's clothes off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any object in Governor Connally's clothing?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Not unusual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice a bullet, specifically?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you hear the sound of anything fall?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there other noises going on in the room at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes, there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Governor Connally completely undressed in the emergency
room?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I believe so, to the best of my knowledge he was, I think
everything was taken off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was done with Governor Connally following the completion
of his being undressed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. He was immediately carried to the elevator&mdash;emergency
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And in what way was he carried to the emergency elevator?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. On the emergency cart that he came into emergency room on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that also describable as a stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say "Yes"?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you assist in pushing him into the elevator?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I started and then there was enough doctors pushing him
and I went back to get his clothing and by the time I came back up again&mdash;I
went just as quickly as I could walk back to trauma room 2 and got the clothing,
I ran back up to catch him, and the elevator was closing with him on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you actually see Governor Connally being wheeled into the
elevator?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No, the door was closing as I got back around. I started
with him down the hall and then before I got back, they had put him into the
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who assisted in pushing him out of the emergency room and
down the hall&mdash;is it a little ways?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, it's through the OB and GYN section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that "Obstetrics and Gynecology" section?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes; you go through that section to get to this elevator
from the major surgery section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far did you help push him from the major surgery section?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. About from the door that went into OBGN.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how far is that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Oh, about 20 feet, I guess, and they had about another 20
feet to go before they turned to the left to get to the elevator, which is about
6 or 8 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, you left him and went back to the emergency room to get
his clothes, and when you came back, did you see any part of the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, I could just see&mdash;I could see the stretcher&mdash;yes; and
the doors and everybody in the elevator and the door was closed in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you see Governor Connally on the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No, not&mdash;I think his feet were at the end&mdash;I could just see
feet&mdash;I believe the feet were there at that door, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, you saw the same doctors around the stretcher who were
pushing him when you last saw him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you sure that was Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No, that's what I said&mdash;I just saw his feet, which I assumed
it was&mdash;it was the same doctors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how long elapsed from the time you stopped pushing
the stretcher until the time you got there to look and see just his feet?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Just a second, I mean, just a few seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You went back and got his clothes?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do with those clothes?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I asked the administrator who should I give them to, and
they told me to give them to Governor Connally's party and they were in the
minor medicine section and I went out there and there were two gentlemen out
there and I asked them who I wanted to see&mdash;I wanted to see somebody in
Governor Connally's party, and they opened the door and they asked for somebody,
and he said he was&mdash;he identified himself as Cliff Carter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you give him the clothing?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what he did with it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you heard what he did with it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I've heard that it got lost and they found it in Representative
Gonzales' office in a closet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is he a Texas Representative?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In his office closet where?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. In Washington, D.C.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you limited in anyway from entering into the operating
room area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. We are limited, but there is a place where the spots are
painted on the floor that is is legal for us to go through into the hallway into
the nurses' station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You can go around in part of the operating room area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Isn't into the premises&mdash;it's just in the hallway into the
nurses' station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the reason for limiting you from going beyond that
into the operating room area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, we are not considered&mdash;we would be contaminating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, is there some problem about flammable gases up there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Anesthesia equipment, that's right, and these spots are
painted there, and if you don't have the proper shoes on, they will be a conductor,
you know, and these spots are there for that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Governor Connally removed from the stretcher at anytime
while he was in the emergency room?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No; he wasn't. He never went to X-ray or he wasn't
taken off at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does the elevator that the stretcher was pushed into go only
to the operating room?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No; it stops on first floor and also goes up to delivery&mdash;up
to the delivery room on third floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is on first floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No patients&mdash;only classrooms and administrative offices&mdash;business
offices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is on third floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. The delivery room&mdash;it opens up into the delivery room and
then the post mortem wards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything you would like to add which you think
might be helpful to us in any way?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, not that I can think of other than that I have already
stated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see President Kennedy's stretcher at any time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes; I was in the room&mdash;I took the mop in. The orderlies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
mopped the floor and we cleaned the wall, the blood off of the walls and so
forth, to get it presentable before Mrs. Kennedy came back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was President Kennedy in the room at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you identified him from what you knew he looked like?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how was he clothed at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, as far as from his waist up&mdash;was all that was uncovered
and they were trying to protect his head with a sheet&mdash;it was wrapped
around his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What clothing did he have on from the waist down?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. It was just a sheet cover&mdash;I don't know of anything under
the cover, whether there was or not. I assumed he was all unclothed, which
we do routinely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He was all unclothed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I said I assumed he was&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did he have from the waist up?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was he on at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. A stretcher cart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see what happened to that stretcher afterward?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I didn't notice. They moved it from the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what happened to the sheets that were on the
President's stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you and I meet previously before I started to take the
deposition here today and talk about the procedures for the investigation by
the Warren Commission?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you and I been discussing here, with me asking
questions and you making answers all the things which we talked about before
the court reporter came in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever talked to any other representative of the Federal
Government?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. The Secret Service&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you talk with them once or more than once?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, I talked with them one time in Mr. Wright's office
and another time just briefly&mdash;he came to see the layout of the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whose office&mdash;Mr. Wright?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Personnel manager here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did the Secret Service men ask you about on those
occasions?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, just the same thing we have gone over today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you talked with the Secret Service man in another part
of the hospital on another day, you say?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. I think he came back up into the emergency room at that
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you talk about in the emergency room at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Well, Mrs. Nelson, she showed him the different areas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you identified some of the things?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever talked with any other representative of the
Federal Government?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any representative of the State government?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much. Those are all&mdash;those are the only
questions I have.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Standridge</span>. Thank you for that.</p>

<h2 id="t120"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_JANE_CAROLYN_WESTER" id="TESTIMONY_OF_JANE_CAROLYN_WESTER">TESTIMONY OF JANE CAROLYN WESTER</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Jane Carolyn Wester was taken on March 20, 1964, at Parkland

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

order creating the Commission and the rules and regulations relating to the

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your occupation or profession, please?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I am a registered nurse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at what institution are you employed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long have you been so employed at Parkland Memorial
Hospital?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Nine years&mdash;or 9 1/2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you outline your duties in a general way as they were
back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I am assistant supervisor in the operating room, and I assign
personnel duties, direct them in their activities.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you receive notice on that date that President Kennedy and
Governor Connally were en route to Parkland Memorial Hospital to receive
treatment?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I was not aware that they were in the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When was it first brought to your attention, if at all?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. At noon, around noon&mdash;noontime&mdash;I'm not sure as to the exact
time it was. I was relieving the secretary for lunch and the phone rang. Someone
in the pathology department asked if the President were in the operating
room and I answered them, "No," and they said that a Secret Service agent was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
down there and as soon as the President did arrive in the operating room, would
I please call them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your next connection, if any, with respect to the treatment
of either President Kennedy or Governor Connally at Parkland?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I received a phone call from the emergency room asking us to
set up for a craniotomy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is a craniotomy in lay language?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. That's an exploration of the head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other request made at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes&mdash;well&mdash;immediately following, following that I received
a call to set up for a thoracotomy, which is an exploration of the chest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were those two set ups made in accordance with the requests
you received?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes; I immediately assigned personnel to set up these two
rooms for these two cases.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what room was used for the craniotomy?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. The craniotomy was set up in room 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what room was used for the thoracotomy?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. The thoracotomy was set up in room 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And on what floor were the two rooms?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Well, on the south wing of the second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What happened next in connection with this matter?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I assigned personnel to take care of the doorways to keep
traffic out of the operating room and keep people back&mdash;keep the halls clear.
Shortly thereafter, Governor Connally arrived in the operating room with several
doctors&mdash;arrived by stretcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, in what way did a stretcher arrive from the first floor, or
by what means of locomotion?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. The stretcher arrived by an elevator which is in the operating
room&mdash;it comes directly from emergency room and which&mdash;there were several
doctors with him that brought the stretchers up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what happened to the stretcher after it left the elevator on
the second floor of the operating room area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. The doctors brought this and were proceeding down the hall,
and I met them in the center of the operating room suite itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how far is that from the elevator door?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Approximately 50 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done then with Governor Connally on the stretcher,
following the point where you met them?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. We proceeded to room 5 and outside of room 5 we transferred
Governor Connally from the stretcher onto an operating table and removed his
clothes from the bottom of the stretcher and placed them in the hallway by the
operating table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what way was Governor Connally dressed or robed when you
first saw him on the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. As far as I know, the only thing he had was a sheet on him.
He had no hospital gown or anything else that I know of on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had his clothes then been removed by that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes; he arrived without his clothes. They were on the bottom
of the cart in a paper sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you said he was transferred from the stretcher onto an
operating table?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, was that inside the operating room? Or outside the operating
room?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. No; it's in the hallway right outside room 5&mdash;we transferred
him onto the operating table, and then moved the table into the operating room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did he have any clothing on at the time you transferred him
from the stretcher onto the operating table?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I don't recall any clothes that he had on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was then done with Governor Connally on the operating
table?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. The operating table was moved into the operating room and
at that time they proceeded to start anesthetics on him and put him to sleep.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors were in attendance of Governor Connally at
that time.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Dr.&mdash;there were many&mdash;Dr. Giesecke, G-i-e-s-e-c-k-e (spelling)&mdash;there
were so many. Dr. Ray, I believe, was there, and there were many
others&mdash;right offhand, I can't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you go into the operating room at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I went as far as the doorway with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what was done with the stretcher on which he came to
that point?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I took the stretcher and rolled it to the center area of the
operating room suite&mdash;rolled the sheets up on the stretcher into a small bundle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there one sheet or more than one sheet?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I believe there were two sheets and I rolled one inside the
other up into a small bundle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is the next normal procedure with respect to the number
of sheets on such a stretcher in like circumstances?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. The cart&mdash;the mattress on the cart is covered with one sheet,
the patient is usually covered with another. When they arrive in the operating
room the sheet covering the patient is removed and a grey cotton blanket is
placed over the patient and the sheets are rolled up and usually returned to
the emergency room with the cart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else, if anything, was on that stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. There were several glassine packets, small packets of hypodermic
needles&mdash;well, packed in and sterilized in. There were several others-some
alcohol sponges and a roll of 1-inch tape. Those things, I definitely know,
were on the cart, and the sheets, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any other objects on the cart, on the stretcher cart?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Right off, I can't <span class="locked">remember&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recollect whether there were any gloves on the cart?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. There could have been&mdash;I don't recall right off&mdash;I can't
remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall whether there were any tools on one end of
the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I know I set something down on the cart, I think it was a
curved hemostat&mdash;I couldn't say for sure&mdash;I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you have testified that you met Governor Connally on
the stretcher when he was 50 feet from the elevator door. Is there any object
at about that spot that is a landmark, so to speak, of that particular spot?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Where I met Governor Connally in the operating room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. There is a clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how far from the clock is the door to the operating
room, room 5, where Governor Connally was taken?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I would say approximately 75 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what did you do with the stretcher after Governor Connally
was taken off of it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. I moved the stretcher back to the center area, fairly close
to the clock, it wasn't right under it, but fairly close, and an orderly, R.&nbsp;J.
Jimison, walked <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. His initials are R. J.?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. And he stood at the cart while I rolled the sheets up and
removed the items from the cart, and from there he took the cart and proceeded
to the elevator with it and the last time I saw him he was standing at the
elevator with the cart waiting for him to be picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see that stretcher any more that day?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe in a general way what that stretcher looked
like?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Well, it has four wheels and a lower shelf, a thin mattress on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
it, and side rails on it, on each side of the cart. It has a rubber rim at the
edge of it, sort of a bumper type to the upper shelf of the cart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is it constructed of?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Well, it's a metal&mdash;steel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done with the mattress?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. It remained on the cart. It was not moved then, only the
sheets were left and rolled into a bundle. And, when the sheets were rolled
into a bundle, I didn't actually lift them up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Miss Jeanette Standridge at any time in connection
with this particular movement of the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Mrs. Henrietta Ross at any time in connection
with this particular movement of the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. No; I believe she walked up on my right as I was rolling the
sheets up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Darrell C. Tomlinson at any time in connection
with this particular movement of the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you interviewed by the Secret Service about these events
at some time in the past?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you interviewed by anyone else?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did the Secret Service interview on one occasion or more
than one occasion?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Only one occasion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And immediately prior to your being sworn in and starting to
take this deposition, did I have a very brief conversation with you about the
purpose of this proceeding?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes; you did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And about the facts to which you have testified since this
formal deposition started?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at that did you tell me all the facts previously testified
to here to this effect?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the sheet on which the Governor was lying have anything
on it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. It had some blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you made any notes or any written record of that sort
concerning the matters about which you have testified here today?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. No; I haven't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That concludes the deposition, and I thank you very much for
appearing here.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Wester</span>. Fine.</p>

1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that the oath has been administered to
Mrs. Henrietta Ross who is appearing here in response to a letter request to
testify as part of the inquiry of the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy, which involves the treatment of President Kennedy and
Governor Connally at Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ross has been asked to appear and testify concerning her knowledge
about the stretcher cart on which Governor Connally was transported while in
the hospital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With that preliminary statement, I'll ask you, Mrs. Ross, to state
your full name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Mrs. Henrietta Magnolia Ross.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where are you employed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Operating room technician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what were your duties on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Stand in the hall and guard the hall and not let anyone pass by I
did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to see Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Yes; as he came down the hall on the cart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him as he left the elevator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. About&mdash;it should have been after 1 o'clock because I was supposed
to go to a class that day and I couldn't go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was with him at the time, if anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. There were doctors all around in the corridor and I don't know
exactly who&mdash;I only remember one person and that was Dr. Gustafason, because
he gave me his coat to hang up as he was passing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Miss Jane Wester there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. She was up there; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you see them do with the Governor, if anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. They pushed him down in front of room 5 and onto the operating
table and put him on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were they pushing him on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. On a stretcher from the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe the stretcher for me, please, starting with what
was it made of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. It has four legs, four wheels and has a little rubber sheet on it. I
mean, a rubber mattress, and the length of the normal body is the length of the
cart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it made of metal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was done with the stretcher cart after they rolled
Governor Connally off of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. It was pushed back up toward room 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that toward the elevator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And by whom was it pushed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you last see the stretcher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. In front of room 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did Jimison have it in his control at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. The last time I looked he was pushing it; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to the Secret Service about this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ross</span>. One time.</p>

this matter?</p>

creating the Commission, a copy of the joint congressional resolution about the

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Well, I would say it wasn't such a pleasant circumstance, but he
was lying on a carriage, a hospital carriage, and I was&mdash;I assisted in helping
move him from the carriage to the operating table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was he when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. He was on the second floor in the operating room suite, near
room 4, where his operation was performed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he taken to room 4 or room 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. He was taken in room&mdash;I thought it was room 4, but maybe it
could have been room 5, but I taken it to be room 4, because like I told you, I
helped lift him off of the table, but usually we help put them in the room&mdash;at
that time there was so many doctors that I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see Governor Connally from the time he came off of the
elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What floor were you on when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I was on two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far was he from the elevator when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I guess he must have been about 20 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how far was it from the elevator to the place where you
were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. About how many feet? About 20 or 30 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he near the big clock when you first saw him, the clock
that is overhead in the center there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were there doctors around him at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you help push the stretcher from that point <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. (interrupting) No; I followed behind him to room 4 and I helped
them take him off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You helped them take Governor Connally and put him on the
operating table?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what then was done with the stretcher that he was on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Well, the stretcher at that time was moved back from the table,
of course, because they had to make room for the doctors to get up close to the
table, which was back just a'ways and when I got free&mdash;whether it was Miss
Wester or Mrs. Ross there&mdash;they pushed it back a little further, but they didn't
get quite to the elevator with it; I came along and pushed it onto the elevator
myself and loaded it on and pushed the door closed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was on the stretcher at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I noticed nothing more than a little flat mattress and two sheets
as usual.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was the position of the sheets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Of course, them sheets was, of course, as usual, flat out on the
bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had they been rolled up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. More or less, not rolled, which, yes, usually they is, the mattress
and sheets are all just throwed, one of them about halfway, it would be just
throwed about halfway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the sheets flat or just turned over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Well, just turned over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were they crumpled up in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Well, there was a possibility it was strictly&mdash;a tragic day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It was what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. It was a tragic day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Right, and everybody was a little shook up on account of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. We didn't look too close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anything else on the stretcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I never noticed anything else at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could there have been some empty packets of hypodermic needles
or an alcohol sponge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. There could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Or a 1-inch roll of tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. There could have been something&mdash;small stuff, but nothing large
like bundles or anything like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you do with the stretcher then, you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Pushed it on the rear elevator, which goes downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any other elevator which goes downstairs to the emergency
area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Not close in the emergency area&mdash;that's the only one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the purpose for your putting it on that elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. It goes back to emergency because it can be cleaned up there
and remade and put in use again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it customarily your job to put it back on the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever take it down and put it in order yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. No, sir; we never carry it down ourselves. The fact is&mdash;the
purpose is&mdash;we have enough to do up there, and we have men up there to take
care of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Somebody else is supposed to take the elevator up there? Is
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. One of them&mdash;we put it on the elevator, then it becomes the
responsibility of the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other stretcher placed on that elevator later
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Not during my shift.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you the only man who would put the stretcher on the
elevator if there were one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. No, I is not, but might near&mdash;I could might near see of anybody&mdash;from
where the elevator sits from where the halls were&mdash;I could might near
see all of the stretchers put on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If a stretcher was put on there it would have to be in your
presence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I would have had to be hid where I wouldn't be able to see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you put the stretcher from Governor Connally
on the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I'm not too sure I know of the time. I really don't know
exactly the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, about how long after he was taken into the operating
room, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. It was lesser than 10 minutes before or after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What time did you get off that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. 3:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you say there was no other stretcher placed on that elevator
from the time you put Governor Connally's stretcher on until the end of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Until the end of my shift. You see, that's the emergency&mdash;from
the emergency that we had from that time that he was brought up until
I was relieved from duty that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any bullets on the stretcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I never noticed any at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did I sit down and talk with you for a few minutes before the
court reporter came in to take this all down here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have I asked you questions and have you given me answers
just like in our short discussion before this deposition started?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. (No response.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you and I talk about the same things we have been talking
about since the court reporter came in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever been talked to by any other person from the
Federal Government?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Yes, I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I don't remember his name, but shortly after that happened&mdash;I
don't know, as I say, it was the Federal Government.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What branch was he from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. I thought he was from the Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many times did you talk to somebody from the Secret
Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Well, I talked to him once; he just talked to me once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. The same thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you ever talk to anybody else about this fact?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add, that you think might be helpful
to us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Well, no, because the fact is&mdash;because that's pretty well covered&mdash;just,
I actually want to give facts about something I know something
about, and during the time I know something about, and what actually happened
from the time I got off&mdash;I couldn't tell you, but I do know there wasn't no
carriage from the time that carriage was picked up until I got off from duty.</p>

<p>This ain't actually&mdash;not in it, but due to this&mdash;this is&mdash;what I'm fixing to say
is off of the book&mdash;I couldn't see after President Kennedy because I didn't&mdash;I
never did get up to the floor&mdash;so I didn't see him. I am glad if was any kind
of help, Mr. Specter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You have been, Mr. Jimison, and we appreciate your coming in
and helping us a lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jimison</span>. Same back to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t128"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DARRELL_C_TOMLINSON" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DARRELL_C_TOMLINSON">TESTIMONY OF DARRELL C. TOMLINSON</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Darrell C. Tomlinson was taken on March 20, 1964, at Parkland
Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant counsel of
the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Tomlinson, this is Miss Oliver, and she is the court reporter.
Will you stand up and hold up your right hand and take the oath,
please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that in the taking of your deposition in these proceedings,
you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name, for the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Darrell Carlisle Tomlinson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Tomlinson, the purpose of this deposition proceeding is to
take your deposition in connection with an inquiry made by the President's
Commission in connection with the Assassination of President Kennedy to determine
from you all the facts, if any, which you know concerning the events
surrounding the assassination of President Kennedy and any treatment which
was given at Parkland Memorial Hospital to either President Kennedy or
Governor Connally, or anything that happened to any physical objects connected
with either one of those men.</p>

<p>First of all, did you receive a letter advising you that the Commission was
interested in having one of its staff lawyers take your deposition concerning
this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did that letter include in it a copy of the Executive order
creating the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And a copy of the congressional resolution concerning the
creation of the President's Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And a copy of the resolution governing questioning of witnesses
by members of the Commission's staff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you willing today for me to ask you some questions
about what you observed or know about this matter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And it is satisfactory with you to proceed today rather than
to have 3 days from the time you got the letter, which was yesterday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. It's immaterial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. It's immaterial to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. It's immaterial&mdash;it's at your convenience.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's fine. We appreciate that, Mr. Tomlinson.</p>

<p>The reason is, that you have the right to a 3-day notice, but if it doesn't
matter to you, then we would like to go ahead and take your information today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We call that a waiver under the law, if it is all right with you
for us to talk with you today, then I want to go ahead and do that; is that all
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, where are you employed, Mr. Tomlinson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Parkland Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I am classed as the senior engineer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what duties are involved in general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I'm in charge of the powerplant here at the hospital, which
takes care of the heating and air-conditioning services for the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe the general physical layout relating to the
emergency area and how you get from the emergency area, say, to the second
floor emergency operating rooms of Parkland Memorial Hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. You mean just the general lay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes, sir; please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, we have one elevator that goes from the basement
to the third floor, that's what we call the emergency elevator. It's in the south
section of the hospital and that would be your most direct route to go from the
ground floor, which emergency is on, to the operating rooms on two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you have anything to do with that elevator on November
22, sometime around the noon hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you have to do with that elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, we received a call in the engineer's office, the chief
engineer's office, and he requested someone to operate the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any problem with the elevator with respect to a
mechanical difficulty of any sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. No, sir; it was an ordinary type elevator, and if it isn't
keyed off it will stop every time somebody pushes a button, and they preferred
it to go only to the second floor and to the ground floor unless otherwise instructed
by the administrator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, what were you to do with this elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Key it off the ground, between ground and second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that you would operate it in that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes; make a manual operation out of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you came upon that elevator, what time was it, to the
best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. It was around 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anything on the elevator at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. There was one stretcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And describe the appearance of that stretcher, if you will,
please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I believe that stretcher had sheets on it and had a white
covering on the pad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you say about the covering on the pad, excuse me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I believe it was a white sheet that was on the pad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was there anything else on that?</p>

<p>Mr.<span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I don't believe there was on that one, I'm not sure, but I
don't believe there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, did you do with that stretcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I took it off of the elevator and put it over against the south
wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. The ground floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other stretcher in that area at that time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. There was a stretcher about 2 feet from the wall already
there.</p>

<p>(Indicating on drawing to which the witness referred.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you have just pointed to a drawing which you have made
of this situation, have you not, while we were talking a few minutes before
the court reporter started to take down your testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you mark in ink with my pen the stretcher which
you pushed off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I think that it was this one right here (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you draw the outline of it in ink and mark an "A" right
in the center of that?</p>

<p>(Witness complied with request of Counsel Specter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you mark in ink the position of the stretcher
which was already on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. This was the ground floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Pardon me, on the ground floor? Is there a different designation
for the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where is the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. One above the ground. We have basement, ground, first,
second, and third on that elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What floor was Governor Connally taken to, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. He was on two, he was in the operating rooms up on two.
That's our surgical suites up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what level is the emergency entrance of the hospital on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, it's the ground floor&mdash;it's there at the back of the
hospital, you see, it's built on the incline there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the elevator which you found in this area was on the
ground floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. The elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The stretcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you mark with a "B" the stretcher which was present
at the time you pushed stretcher "A" off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. (Witness complied with the request of Counsel Specter.)
I believe that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what, if anything, did you later observe as to stretcher
"B"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, sir; I don't recall how long it had been exactly, but
an intern or doctor, I didn't know which, came to use the men's room there in
the elevator lobby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where is the men's room located on this diagram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. It would be right there (indicating) beside the "B" stretcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you draw in ink there the outline of that room in a
general way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, I really don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And would you mark that with the letter "C"?</p>

<p>(Witness complied with request of Counsel Specter.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's fine. What happened when that gentleman came to
use the men's room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, he pushed the stretcher out from the wall to get in,
and then when he came out he just walked off and didn't push the stretcher
back up against the wall, so I pushed it out of the way where we would have
clear area in front of the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you push it to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I pushed it back up against the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What, if anything, happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I bumped the wall and a spent cartridge or bullet rolled
out that apparently had been lodged under the edge of the mat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And that was from which stretcher?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I believe that it was "B".</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was on "B", if you recall; if anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, at one end they had one or two sheets rolled up; I
didn't examine them. They were bloody. They were rolled up on the east
end of it and there were a few surgical instruments on the opposite end and
a sterile pack or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A sterile what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. A sterile pack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Like gauze or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there an alcohol sponge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. There could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there a roll of 1-inch tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any empty packets from hypodermic needles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, now, it had some paper there but I don't know what
they came from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, Mr. Tomlinson, are you sure that it was stretcher "A"
that you took out of the elevator and not stretcher "B"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, really, I can't be positive, just to be perfectly honest
about it, I can't be positive, because I really didn't pay that much attention
to it. The stretcher was on the elevator and I pushed it off of there and I
believe we made one or two calls up before I straightened out the stretcher
up against the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "one or two calls," what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Went to pick up the technician from the second floor to
bring him down to the ground floor to get blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you say before you straightened the stretcher up,
what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, we just rolled them out of the way where we had
some room on the elevator&mdash;that's a small elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, when you rolled them out of the elevator, when you rolled
the stretcher out of the elevator, did you place it against the wall at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were both of these stretchers constructed in the same way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Similar&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe the appearance of the stretcher with reference
to what it was made of and how many shelves it had, and that sort of
thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, it's made of tubed steel with a flat iron frame on the
top where you lay the patient and it has one shelf down between the four
wheels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does it have any bumpers on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes, and it has rubber bumpers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Does it have any rail to keep the patient on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes; they have the rails on the side made of tubed steel.
The majority of them have those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, just before we started this deposition, before I placed
you under oath and before the court reporter started to take down my questions
and your answers, you and I had a brief talk, did we not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And we discussed in a general way the information which
you have testified about, did we not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at the time we started our discussion, it was your recollection
at that point that the bullet came off of stretcher A, was it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. B.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Pardon me, stretcher B, but it was stretcher A that you took
off of the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I believe that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But there is no question but that at the time we started our
discussion a few minutes before the court reporter started to take it down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
that your best recollection was that it was stretcher A which came off of the
elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes, I believe that was it&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been interviewed about this matter by any other
Federal representative?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who interviewed you about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I don't remember the name of either one of them, but one
was the FBI man and one was the Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many times did the FBI interview you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many times did the Secret Service interview you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did the FBI interview you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I believe they were the first to do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Approximately when was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I think that was the latter part of November.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when did the Secret Service interview you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Approximately a week later, the first part of December.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, do you recollect what the FBI man asked you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Just about where I found the bullet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he ask you about these stretchers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, he asked me about the stretchers, yes, just about the
same thing we've gone over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did the Secret Service man ask you about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Approximately the same thing, only, we've gone into more
detail here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you tell the Secret Service man about which stretcher
you took off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I told him that I was not sure, and I am not&mdash;I'm not
sure of it, but as I said, I would be going against the oath which I took a while
ago, because I am definitely not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you remember if you told the Secret Service man which
stretcher you thought you took off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, we talked about taking a stretcher off of the elevator,
but then when it comes down on an oath, I wouldn't say for sure, I really
don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you recollect whether or not you told the Secret Service
man which stretcher you took off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say you can't really take an oath today to be sure whether
it was stretcher A or stretcher B that you took off the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Well, today or any other day, I'm just not sure of it, whether
it was A or B that I took off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, has your recollection always been the same about the
situation, that is, today, and when you talked to the Secret Service man and
when you talked to the FBI man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes; I told him that I wasn't sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, what you told the Secret Service man was just about the
same thing as you have told me today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When I first started to ask you about this, Mr. Tomlinson, you
initially identified stretcher A as the one which came off of the elevator car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes; I think it's just like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, then, <span class="locked">when&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span> (interrupting). Here's the deal&mdash;I rolled that thing off, we
got a call, and went to second floor, picked the man up and brought him down.
He went on over across, to clear out of the emergency area, but across from it,
and picked up two pints of, I believe it was, blood. He told me to hold for him,
he had to get right back to the operating room, so I held, and the minute he hit
there, we took off for the second floor and I came back to the ground. Now,
I don't know how many people went through that&mdash;I don't know how many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
people hit them&mdash;I don't know anything about what could have happened to
them in between the time I was gone, and I made several trips before I discovered
the bullet on the end of it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You think, then, that this could have been either, you took out
of the elevator as you sit here at the moment, or you just can't be sure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. It could be, but I can't be positive or positively sure&mdash;I
think it was A, but I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That you took off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, before I started to ask you questions under oath, which
have been taken down here, I told you, did I not, that the Secret Service man
wrote a report where he said that the bullet was found on the stretcher which
you took off of the elevator&mdash;I called that to your attention, didn't I?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes; you told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, after I tell you that, does that have any effect on refreshing
your recollection of what you told the Secret Service man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. No; it really doesn't&mdash;it really doesn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, would it be a fair summary to say that when I first started
to talk to you about it, your first view was that the stretcher you took off of the
elevator was stretcher A, and then I told you that the Secret Service man said
it was&mdash;that you had said the stretcher you took off of the elevator was the
one that you found the bullet off, and when we talked about the whole matter
and talked over the entire situation, you really can't be completely sure about
which stretcher you took off of the elevator, because you didn't push the
stretcher that you took off of the elevator right against the wall at first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, there was a lot of confusion that day, which is what
you told me before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Absolutely. And now, honestly, I don't remember telling
him definitely&mdash;I know we talked about it, and I told him that it could have
been. Now, he might have drawed his own conclusion on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You told the Secret Service agent that you didn't know <span class="locked">where&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span> (interrupting). He asked me if it could have been brought
down from the second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You got the stretcher from where the bullet came from, whether
it was brought down from the second floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. It could have been&mdash;I'm not sure whether it was A I took off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But did you tell the Secret Service man which one you thought
it was you took off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I'm not clear on that&mdash;whether I absolutely made a positive
statement to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You told him that it could have been B you took off of the
elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But, you don't remember whether you told him it was A you
took off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. I think it was A&mdash;I'm not really sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which did you tell the Secret Service agent&mdash;that you thought
it was A that you took off of the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Really, I couldn't be real truthful in saying I told him
this or that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You just don't remember for sure whether you told him you
thought it was A or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. No, sir; I really don't remember. I'm not accustomed to
being questioned by the Secret Service and the FBI and by you and they are
writing down everything, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's all right. I understand exactly what you are saying
and I appreciate it and I really just want to get your best recollection.</p>

<p>We understand it isn't easy to remember all that went on, on a day like
November 22d, and that a man's recollection is not perfect like every other part
of a man, but I want you to tell me just what you remember, and that's the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
best you can do today, and I appreciate that, and so does the President's Commission,
and that's all we can ask a man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes, I'm going to tell you all I can, and I'm not going to
tell you something I can't lay down and sleep at night with either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know where the stretcher came from that you found on
the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. No, sir; I do not. It could have come from two, it could
have come from three, it could have come from some other place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You didn't see anybody put it there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. No, sir&mdash;it was on the elevator when I got there. There
wasn't anyone on the elevator at the time when I keyed it off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you say "keyed it off," you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Put it in manual operation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Tomlinson, does it make any difference to you whether
you sign this deposition at the end or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. We very much appreciate your coming, Mr. Tomlinson. Thank
you very much. Those are all the questions I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion between counsel and the witness Tomlinson regarding a proposed
exhibit.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On the record.</p>

<p>Now that the deposition of Mr. Tomlinson has been concluded, I am having
the paper marked as Tomlinson Exhibit No. 2.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as Tomlinson Exhibit No. 2, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Mr. Tomlinson is present, and will
you identify this paper marked Tomlinson Exhibit No. 2 as the one which
contains the diagram of the emergency room and the letters A and B of the
stretchers we have been discussing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. That's just the elevator lobby in emergency.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And this is the diagram which you drew for us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Tomlinson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's all, and thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t134"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DIANA_HAMILTON_BOWRON" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DIANA_HAMILTON_BOWRON">TESTIMONY OF DIANA HAMILTON BOWRON</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Diana Hamilton Bowron was taken at 2:05 p.m., on
March 24, 1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Diana Bowron is present following
a verbal request that she appear here to have her deposition taken. During
the course of deposition proceedings on March 20 and March 21, it came to my
attention that Miss Bowron would have information of value to the Commission,
and authorization was provided through the General Counsel, J. Lee Rankin,
for her deposition to be taken.</p>

<p>Miss Bowron, the President's Commission is investigating the assassination
of President Kennedy and is interested in certain facts relating to his treatment
and presence at Parkland Memorial Hospital, and we have asked you to
appear here to testify concerning your knowledge of his presence here.</p>

<p>Now, I have shown you, have I not, the Executive order appointing the
Presidential Commission and the resolution authorizing the taking of testimony
at depositions by Commission staff members, have I not?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you willing to have your deposition taken today without
3 days' written notice, as we ordinarily provide?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, are you willing to waive that technical requirement?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes, I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Will you stand up and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give before the President's
Commission in these deposition proceedings will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your permanent residence address, Miss Bowron?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. 1107 Brockbank, Dallas 29, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you spell that street name and speak up more loudly?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. B-r-o-c-k-b-a-n-k [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you. Are you a native of Dallas, or of some other area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I am a native of England.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long have you been in Dallas?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Since August 4, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what are the circumstances surrounding your employment
here at Parkland Memorial Hospital?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I answered an advertisement in August and came over on a
year's contract and to work in the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you a registered nurse?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your educational background?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I went to private boarding school and to secondary school,
and then I went through nurses training for 3 years and 3 months in England.
I finished in February of last year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how old are you at the present time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Twenty two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have occasion to render assistance to President Kennedy
back on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I did; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you relate briefly the circumstances surrounding your
being called in to assist in that case?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I was assigned to work in the minor medicine and surgery
area, and I was passing through major surgery, and I heard over the intercom
that they needed carts out at the emergency room entrance, so the orderly
from the triage desk, which was passing through and he and I took one cart
from major surgery and ran down the hall and by the cashier's desk there were
some men I assume were Secret Service men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know at that time whom you were going to aid?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You later assumed they were Secret Service men?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes, sir, and they encouraged us to run down to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you have a stretcher with you at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was one stretcher or more than one stretcher being brought
forward at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. There was another stretcher being brought forward from the
OB&mdash;GYN section.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's the obstetrics and gynecology section?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you wheeling one stretcher by yourself or was some
one helping?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, the orderly from the triage desk was helping us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was helping you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Joe&mdash;I've forgotten what his last name is. I'm sorry. I know
his first name is Joe and he's on duty today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was bringing the other stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I don't know, sir. I heard afterwards, that Dr. Midgett took
one stretcher. I don't know who was assisting him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is Dr. Midgett's first name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Bill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, where did you take your stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. To the left-hand side of the car as you are facing it, and we
had to move Governor Connally out first because he was in the front. We
couldn't get to the back seat. While all the Secret Service men were moving
Governor Connally I went around to the other side of the car to try to help
with the President and then we got him onto the second cart and then took
him straight over to trauma room 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Trauma room No. 1?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And describe in a general way Governor Connally's condition
when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. He was very pale, he was leaning forward and onto Mrs. Connally
but apparently&mdash;I didn't notice very much&mdash;I was more concerned with
the person in the back of the car&mdash;the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, in a general way, did you observe with respect to
President Kennedy's condition?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. He was moribund&mdash;he was lying across Mrs. Kennedy's knee
and there seemed to be blood everywhere. When I went around to the other
side of the car I saw the condition of his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You saw the condition of his what?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. The back of his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was that condition?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Well, it was very bad&mdash;you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many holes did you see?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I just saw one large hole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see a small bullet hole beneath that one large hole?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice any other wound on the President's body?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what action did you take at that time, if any?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I helped to lift his head and Mrs. Kennedy pushed me away
and lifted his head herself onto the cart and so I went around back to the cart
and walked off with it. We ran on with it to the trauma room and she ran
beside us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was in the trauma room when you arrived there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Dr. Carrico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did Dr. Carrico join you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. At the&mdash;I couldn't really tell you exactly, but it was inside
major surgery. Miss Henchliffe, the other nurse who is assigned to major
surgery, was in the trauma room already setting the I.V.'s&mdash;the intravenous
bottles up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were there any other nurses present at that time when
the President arrived in the trauma area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I don't think so, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any doctors present besides Dr. Carrico?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I didn't notice anybody&mdash;there may have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action did you observe Dr. Carrico take, if any?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. We tried to start an I.V. cutdown and I don't know whether
it was his left or his right leg, and Miss Henchliffe and I cut off his clothing and
then after that everybody just arrived at once and it was more or less everybody
sort of helping everybody else. We opened the chest tube trays and the
venesectron trays.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long were you present in the emergency room No. 1?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I was in there until they needed some blood, which was the
second lot of blood. I went&mdash;ran out across to the blood bank and came back
and went into the trauma room. By that time they had decided that he was
dead, they said.</p>

<p>And then, we stayed in there with him and cleaned him up, removed all
of his clothing and put them all together and Miss Henchliffe gave them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
one of the Secret Service men, and we stayed with the body until the coffin came,
and helped put him in there, and then <span class="locked">we&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "we", whom do you mean by "we"?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Miss Henchliffe and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Anybody besides the two of you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes; there was an orderly called David Sanders who helped
us to clean the floor, because there were leaves and sheets and everything was
rather a mess on the floor and he came to clean the floor for us so that it
wouldn't look so bad when Mrs. Kennedy went in. And then Mrs. Kennedy
wanted to be alone with him after the priests left, so we all came out and sat
there outside and she was alone with him in the trauma room, and we didn't
go in any more after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him at any time after that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir&mdash;only when they were wheeling him out in the coffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What doctors were present during the time he was being
treated?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Dr. Carrico and&mdash;who else was there&mdash;there were so many.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you recall any of the names?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any other nurses present other than those you have
already mentioned?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Miss Standridge, Jeanette Standridge came in, Mrs. Nelson&mdash;the
supervisor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any other nurses present there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Not that I could say, sir&mdash;I don't know the name of any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. While the doctors were working on President Kennedy, did you
ever have any opportunity to observe his neck?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No; I didn't, until afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Until after what?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Until after they had pronounced him dead and we cleaned up
and removed the trach tube, and indeed we were really too shocked to really
take much notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see his neck prior to the time you removed the
trach tube?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you personally participate in removing President
Kennedy's body from the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir&mdash;I didn't touch him. We held him with the sheet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present when his body was removed from the
stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you observe the stretcher from which his body was
removed to be the same stretcher that he had been brought into trauma room
No. 1 on?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's the stretcher you took out there for him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what sheets were present on the stretcher or in the adjacent
area used in the care of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. The sheets that had already been on the stretcher when we
took it out with the President on. When we came back after all the work had
been done on him&mdash;so that Mrs. Kennedy could have a look before he was, you
know, really moved into the coffin. We wrapped some extra sheets around his
head so it wouldn't look so bad and there were some sheets on the floor so
that nobody would step in the blood. Those were put down during all the
work that was going on so the doctors wouldn't slip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done with all of the sheets on the stretcher and on
floor area there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. They were all gathered up and put into a linen scape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you gather them up yourself?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All of them?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes; with the help of Miss Henchliffe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did the two of you put them in the linen hamper?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes; I put them in the linen hamper myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done with the stretcher then?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. The stretcher was then wheeled across into trauma room No. 2,
which was empty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there anything on the stretcher at all when it was wheeled
into trauma room No. 2?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Not that we noticed, except the rubber mattress that was
left on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you have noticed anything had anything been on that
stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where was the stretcher when you last saw it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Being wheeled across into trauma room 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, I am going to show you three photostatic copies of newspaper
stories which I will ask the Court Reporter to mark Bowron Exhibit
Nos. 2, 3 and 4.</p>

<p>(Instruments referred to marked by the Reporter as Bowron Exhibit Nos. 2,
3, and 4, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you look at those and tell me whether or not those are photostatic
copies of newspaper accounts of your story of this assassination day?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. They are photostatic copies of the articles that appeared in
the newspapers, but they are not all my story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What newspapers did they appear in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I believe this is the "Observer".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are referring to BX Number 2 and what city is that published
in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. London.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And BX Number 3 came from where?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I think that this was "The Mail&mdash;The Daily Mail".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Appearing in what city?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. It appears in all cities. It is a national newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In England?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes; it is prepared in England.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about BX-4?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Well, this I think was "The Mirror" I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What city is The Mirror published in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. That is a national newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Appearing in England?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any stories in any other newspapers about you and
your participation in the events of the day at Parkland?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I believe there was one&mdash;I think it was an Australian paper
and Mrs. Nelson received a letter from there with an article and which was
the same as I think&mdash;as this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. BX-4?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And does that constitute all the stories which appeared about
your participation in this event?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, will you state briefly the circumstances under which this
information was obtained, if you know?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Mrs. Nelson spoke to me and told me that there had been two
English reporters in Dallas who had been asking about me, and she told them
where to get in touch with me, and the next day they came to the emergency
room and wanted to speak to me and I said I couldn't tell them anything other
than I was from England, gave them my home address, and the fact that I had
been present and I was the one who went out to the car and brought the President
in and being with him until they finished, and that was all that I told
them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you give them any information beyond that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir; and they told me that there would probably be some
English reporters calling on my parents at home, and I am the only child and
my mother worries, so I called home the next&mdash;that night and told my parents
that I had been on duty and that there would probably be some reporters
calling on them, and they weren't to worry about it but they weren't to say anything
that&mdash;except that I had been on duty and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you been interviewed by any representative of the Federal
Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. I don't really know&mdash;he was an FBI agent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when was that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. It was a week or two, I think, after the assassination.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did he ask you and what did you tell him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. He asked us more or less the same questions you have asked us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. The same as I told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "us", whom do you mean by "us"?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Mrs. Nelson was there and Miss Henchliffe and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you talked to any other representatives of the Federal
Government prior to today?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did I discuss with you the purpose of the deposition and
the nature of the questions that I would ask you immediately before we went
on the record with this being taken down by the Court Reporter?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you give me the same information which you have
put on the record here today?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything to add that you think might be helpful
in any way to the Commission?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes. When we were doing a cutdown on the President's left
arm, his gold watch was in the way and they broke it&mdash;you know, undid it and
it was slipping down and I just dropped it off of his hand and put it in my
pocket and forgot completely about it until his body was being taken out of the
emergency room and then I realized, and ran out to give it to one of the
Secret Service men or anybody I could find and found this Mr. Wright.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was that the same day?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Yes&mdash;he had only just gone through O.B.&mdash;I was just a few
feet behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think of anything else that might be of assistance to
the Commission?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for coming, Miss Bowron.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you a lot.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Bowron</span>. All right, thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t139"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MARGARET_M_HENCHLIFFE" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MARGARET_M_HENCHLIFFE">TESTIMONY OF MARGARET M. HENCHLIFFE</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Margaret M. Henchliffe was taken at 2 p.m., on March 21,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Miss Henchliffe, the purpose of our asking you to come in today
is in connection with the investigation being conducted by the President's Commission
on the Assassination of President Kennedy. The Commission has not
written to you because, we have learned from Mrs. Doris Nelson in the deposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
taken yesterday that you have some information of value to provide to us
so that the regular procedure has not been followed of sending you a copy of
the Executive order or of the resolution concerning the procedures of the taking
of testimony.</p>

<p>Permit me to make those documents available to you.</p>

<p>(Handed instruments to the Witness Henchliffe.)</p>

<p>Let me say that since yesterday I have contacted Mr. J. Lee Rankin, General
Counsel, in Washington and he has authorized the taking of this deposition
by letter, which I received today, so that it has been authorized, and the real
question I have with you is whether it is all right with you to provide us with
the information you have today, as opposed to sometime next week after you
have had the 3 days' notice which you are entitled to if you want it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. It is all right with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it all right with you to proceed and have your deposition
taken today?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give before
this Commission as it is holding deposition proceedings now will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Margaret M. Henchliffe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your occupation or profession?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. I am a nurse, registered nurse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where are you employed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Parkland Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where were you employed on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Parkland Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you notified on that date that the President was on
his way to the hospital?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. No, sir; I didn't know it at the time until later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you first learn about it, if at all?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. I found out who it was when I went out to get blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About what time of day was that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well. I guess it was about 2 minutes after he came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe him at some place in the hospital?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. I was working with him in the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had he arrived in the emergency room when you first arrived
at the site of the emergency room?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Do what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you in the area of the emergency room before he came
there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him actually wheeled into the emergency room?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes; in fact, I helped wheel him on into trauma room 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, where was he when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. He was between trauma rooms 1 and 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him when he was brought into the hospital itself?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. At the emergency entrance&mdash;no. It was after he came
into the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He came into the emergency area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And then you saw him and helped wheel him, you say, into
the emergency room No. 1?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who else was present at the time you first saw him when
he had just come into the emergency area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Let me see, I think Dr. Carrico was there&mdash;he was there
very shortly after&mdash;afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He was there when you arrived? Or arrived shortly after
you did?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, actually I went in ahead of the cart with him and
I was the first one in with him, and just in a minute, or seconds, Dr. Carrico
came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what other doctors arrived, if any?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Oh, gee. Let's see&mdash;there was Dr. Baxter, Dr. Perry, and
you want all of them that were in the room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you can remember them.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Dr. Kemp Clark, Dr. Jenkins, Dr. Peters, Dr. Crenshaw,
and there was some woman anesthetist that I don't know which&mdash;who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe to be the President's condition when
you first saw him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. I saw him breathe a couple of times and that was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see any wound anywhere on his body?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes, he was very bloody; his head was very bloody when
I saw him at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see any wound in any other part of his body?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. When I first saw him&mdash;except his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see any wound on any other part of his body?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes; in the neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you describe it, please?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. It was just a little hole in the middle of his neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. About how big a hole was it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. About as big around as the end of my little finger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever had any experience with bullet holes?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did that appear to you to be?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. An entrance bullet hole&mdash;it looked to me like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could it have been an exit bullet hole?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. I have never seen an exit bullet hole&mdash;I don't remember
seeing one that looked like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were the characteristics of the hole?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. It was just a little round&mdash;just a little round hole, just a
little round jagged-looking&mdash;jagged a little bit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What experience have you had in observing bullet holes, Miss
Henchliffe?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, we take care of a lot of bullet wounds down there&mdash;I
don't know how many a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever had any formal studies of bullet holes?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Oh, no; nothing except my experience in the emergency
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In what?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. In the emergency room is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done to the President after he arrived at the emergency
room?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well the first thing, his endotracheal tube was inserted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present all the time he was in the emergency room?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Except when I left out to get blood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long were you gone?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Oh, about 3 minutes or so&mdash;3 or 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you present when he was pronounced dead?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done with the President's body after he was pronounced
to be dead?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, after the last rites were said, we then undressed him
and cleaned him up and wrapped him up in sheets until the coffin was brought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And after the coffin arrived, what was done with his body?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. He was placed in the coffin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What had he been on up until that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. An emergency room cart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that also described as a stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. A stretcher&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you describe what this stretcher looked like?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, how do you describe a stretcher&mdash;it's just a <span class="locked">long&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Made of metal?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes; it's made of metal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On roller wheels?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Roller wheels with a rubber mattress on it, rubber covered
mattress on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And after he was taken off of the stretcher, what was left on
the stretcher at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Just some sheets and I guess there were some dirty syringes
and needles laying on it that we picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That you picked up&mdash;where were they placed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. We placed them on a tray and took them all out to the
utility room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many sheets were there on the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, I am really not sure&mdash;there was probably about two
or three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And in what position were they all on the stretcher after President
Kennedy's body was removed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, one was covering the whole mattress and there was
one or two that we had left just under his head, that had been placed under
his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was done with those sheets?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. They were all rolled up and taken to the dirty linen
hamper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know who took those to the dirty linen hamper?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. To the best of my knowledge, the orderly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who was he?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. David Sanders&mdash;is that his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was done with the stretcher?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. It was rolled into the room across the hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you actually see the stretcher that President Kennedy was
on rolled into the room across the hall?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And into which room was it rolled?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Room 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Room 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Emergency room No. 2?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, when it was rolled into emergency room 2, were the sheets
still all on, or were they off at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. I believe they were off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it possible that the stretcher that Mr. Kennedy was on was
rolled with the sheets on it down into the area near the elevator?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you sure of that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. I am positive of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you anything to add that you think might be helpful to
the Commission?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. No, sir; I don't think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did I talk to you about the purpose of the Commission and the
same questions that I have been asking and the answers that you have been
giving for a few minutes before the Court reporter came in to take this down
in shorthand?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you give me the same information at that time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. To the best of my ability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for coming.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>(At this point the witness, Henchliffe, was thereupon excused from the
deposing room.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
(In approximately 3 minutes thereafter the witness returned to the deposing
room and the deposition continued as follows:)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let me ask you a couple of questions more, Miss Henchliffe,
one other question, or two, before you go.</p>

<p>Was the wound on the front of the neck surrounded by any blood?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any blood at all in that area?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was there about the wound, if you recall anything special,
which gave you the impression it was an entrance wound?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, it was just a small wound and wasn't jagged like
most of the exit bullet wounds that I have seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If there was a high-powered rifle, or a high-powered rifle was
going at a fast speed, as fast as 2,000 feet per second, which encountered only
soft tissue in the body, would you have sufficient knowledge to know whether
or not the appearance of that hole would be consistent with an exit wound?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, from some information I received in talking to
someone about guns later on, they said that this is possible. But you have a
small exit wound&mdash;you could have a small exit wound.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Under what circumstances?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. As you described&mdash;a very fast bullet that didn't hit anything
but soft tissue going through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you have any other source of information or basis for
having an opinion whether it was an entrance wound or an exit wound other
than that source of information you just described, plus your general experience
here at Parkland as a nurse?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you been at Parkland as a nurse?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, I have had emergency room experience for about 5
years here and a couple of years at Baylor Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that the total sum of your experience?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. In the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what other experience have you had besides emergency
room experience?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Well, in the operating room here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long have you had operating room experience here?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long have you been a registered nurse altogether?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. 12 years&mdash;almost 12 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the source of information about the appearance
of an exit wound from a high-powered gun which you have just described?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. I don't remember who I was talking to now. I was just
talking to someone one day about gunshots and after this report came out that
said that any high-powered gun that this could happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That it could be an exit wound which looked very much like
an entrance wound with the missile striking nothing but soft tissue?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you have anything else to add?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Henchliffe</span>. All right.</p>

<h2 id="t143"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_DORIS_MAE_NELSON" id="TESTIMONY_OF_DORIS_MAE_NELSON">TESTIMONY OF DORIS MAE NELSON</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Doris Mae Nelson was taken on March 20, 1964, at Parkland
Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Nelson, this is Miss Oliver, the court reporter, and will you
raise your right hand and take the oath?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give in this proceeding will be
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Mrs. Doris Nelson is appearing to
testify in this deposition proceeding conducted by the President's Commission on
the Assassination of President Kennedy to provide whatever facts, if any, she
may know concerning the treatment received by President Kennedy and Governor
Connally at Parkland Memorial Hospital on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Doris Mae Nelson. Do you want my maiden name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine, yes; what is your maiden name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Morris, M-o-r-r-i-s [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Nelson, have you had an opportunity to view the joint resolution
of the 88th Congress and the Executive order which established the President's
Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; I read it yesterday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And have you had an opportunity to view the resolution of the
President's Commission covering questioning of witnesses by members of the
Commission staff?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you willing to be questioned today concerning this
matter, even though you have not had 3 days' notice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Therefore waiving the right which you have, a 3 days' notice
under the resolution?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your occupation or profession?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. I am a registered nurse, supervisor of the emergency room at
Parkland Memorial Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how long have you been so occupied?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. A year and 6 months as supervisor of the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were your duties in a general way on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. I was primarily responsible for assigning personnel in the treatment
of the injured patients and carrying out security measures with the Secret
Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What notification, if any, did you receive on that date concerning
injuries to President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. I received a phone call approximately 3 to 5 minutes prior to
their arrival, from the telephone operator, stating that the President had been
shot and was being brought to the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What action after that did you take in preparing for the
President's arrival?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. I immediately took the surgical resident into trauma room No. 1,
notified him of the incident, and asked the&mdash;also told the head nurse that the
President had been shot and was being brought to the emergency room.</p>

<p>Then, I went into trauma room 2, after the head nurse had told me that
trauma room 1 was set up for any emergency, and proceeded to open a bottle of
intravenous fluid and set it up for an emergency situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you know at that time that anyone else had been injured?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. No; we were not notified as to anyone else being injured.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What occurred with respect to the arrival of any injured party
at Parkland Memorial Hospital thereafter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. As I walked out of trauma room No. 2 I heard someone calling
for stretchers and an orderly ran back into the area and got a stretcher and
ran out of the door, and a few seconds later Governor Connally, who at that
time I did not know who it was but recognized him as not being the President,
arrived and I directed them into trauma room 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did the orderly take out one stretcher, or was more than one
stretcher taken out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. I do not know exactly how many stretchers were taken out at
the time because I was not out at that area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did another stretcher come into the area?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; immediately behind the Governor another stretcher was
brought back into the emergency room and on this stretcher was President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How were you able to identify President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Well, I could look and see him and tell that it was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What part did you see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. The&mdash;mainly his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was there any coat covering his face?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. There was a coat thrown across the top of him, not completely
covering his face, and Mrs. Kennedy&mdash;do you want me to tell about Mrs. Kennedy
and the flowers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; continue. Yes; in answering the questions, Mrs. Nelson,
feel perfectly free to make as full an answer to the question&mdash;I hesitate to
have you stop, so that the record we make will appear continuous and everything
may be recorded fully for our record purposes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Mrs. Kennedy was walking beside the stretcher and the roses
that she had been given at the airport were lying on top of the President and
her hat was also lying on top of the President as he was brought into the
emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was he then taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. He was immediately taken into trauma room 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who, if anyone, was present at that time to attend him in
a medical way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Dr. Carrico, a surgical resident was there at the time that he
was brought in, and Dr. Perry, an associate professor of surgery arrived shortly
thereafter, and several doctors arrived, Dr. Baxter, associate professor of
surgery, Dr. Kemp Clark, professor of neurosurgery and chairman of the
department; Dr. <span class="locked">Bashour&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Spell, please.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. B-a-s-h-o-u-r (spelling), chairman of the Department of
Cardiology, and several other doctors who I cannot recall all the names at
the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you present inside of the emergency room where President
Kennedy was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. When what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you in there at the time they were treating him, caring
for him at any time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. On one occasion I went into the room and this was mainly
to ask Mrs. Kennedy if she had rather wait out in the hallway rather than
in the room where they were treating the President, and I was told by the
Secret Service agent that she may stay in there if she wished.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any table, or was there any table in the emergency
room to which President Kennedy was taken that he could be placed on from
the stretcher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is it the normal situation to have no table present in the
emergency room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. The only one there is in case an ambulance should bring a
patient in, but if a patient comes in the emergency room on a stretcher,
then the stretcher that is in there is removed. Then the patient remains on
the same stretcher that he comes into the emergency room on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was there a stretcher in the emergency room at the time
President Kennedy was taken in on a second stretcher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. It was taken out when they wheeled it in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there any sheets on the stretcher that President Kennedy
was on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. After President Kennedy was taken off of the stretcher, did you
have occasion to observe that stretcher?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; the stretcher was stripped by the nursing personnel working
in the room and the stretcher was moved across from trauma room 1 to
trauma room 2 in order to get the stretcher out of the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What personnel stripped the stretcher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Margaret Henchliffe, H-e-n-c-h-l-i-f-f-e [spelling], and Diana
Bowron, D-i-a-n-a B-o-w-r-o-n [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you actually observe Diana Bowron or Margaret Henchliffe
strip the stretcher?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. No; I did not. This was the report that I received afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From whom did you receive that report?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. From these two nurses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see the stretcher after it was stripped in the emergency
room to which President Kennedy was taken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. No, I saw it after it was wheeled from trauma room 1 to trauma
room 2, because I was standing there at the doorway between the two rooms
with the Secret Service Police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But it was actually in trauma room 1?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As it was being wheeled out to trauma room 2 and at the time
it was being wheeled out, was there any sheet on it at <span class="locked">all&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Rolled up on it in any way at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see where the stretcher was then placed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes, it was put into trauma room 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was President Kennedy's body at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. It was in&mdash;it had been placed in a casket in trauma room 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was the casket on any sort of an object or was it on the
floor or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. It was on a form of roller-type table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did&mdash;do you know what President Kennedy's body was in,
if anything, at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes, one of the nurses, Miss Hutton, came out and said that the
President was having extensive bleeding from the head and they had wrapped
four sheets around it but it was still oozing through, so I sent her to the second
floor to obtain a mattress cover, a plastic mattress cover, to put in the casket
prior to putting his body in the casket, so the mattress cover was placed in the
casket and I did not see this happen, but this is how it was explained to me by
the nurse, and the plastic was placed on the mattress cover and the cover was
around the mattress.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which nurse explained that to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Miss Bowron and Miss Henchliffe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what was done with the sheets which had been used to
absorb the blood from the President's body?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Well, there were approximately four sheets wrapped around
him and the remaining sheets that were on the stretcher were pulled up and
thrown in the linen hamper, according to Miss Bowron and Miss Henchliffe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where is that linen hamper located?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. That linen hamper is located in the utility room area of the
emergency room, which is just outside of the trauma room area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what floor is that on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. On the ground floor of the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was done with Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Governor Connally was in the emergency room for a very short
period, approximately 15 to 20 minutes, at which time he had chest tubes inserted,
intravenous fluid started, anesthesia or oxygen given to him, and he
was taken immediately from the emergency room to the operating room accompanied
by several doctors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him inside trauma room No. 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you observe him when he was taken out of trauma
room No. 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes, I saw him when he went upstairs to the operating room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how did he get upstairs to the operating room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. On a stretcher carried by several of the doctors. Miss Standridge
went in front, and opened doorways and went to the elevator. I could not see
her at the elevator but this is what she told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How far could you see her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Oh, approximately 30 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And who is Miss Standridge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Head nurse in the emergency room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is her first name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Jeanette.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You say the stretcher was carried?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Well, it was wheeled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what does the stretcher look like that Governor Connally
was on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Well, there are no specific details, it's an average type of movable
four-wheel stretcher, made out of metal, with a plastic mattress on the stretcher.
It has an elevation between&mdash;on the sides, so that the&mdash;I don't know how to
explain exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. A bumper-type effect?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. It has a bumper on the side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there a tray underneath the place where the body was resting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that the same general description of a stretcher that
President Kennedy was brought in on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; they were the same type.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Nelson, I'm going to show you a four-page statement which
is marked "Activities of Doris Nelson, R.N., beginning 12 noon, Friday, November
22, 1963," after I ask that it be marked as an exhibit in connection with this
deposition.</p>

<p>(Reporter marked the instrument referred to as Nelson Exhibit No. 1.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is this a photostatic copy of the statement which you gave to
Mr. Jack Price, the administrator of the hospital, concerning your activities
on November 22, 1963, as they pertain to this matter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are the facts set forth herein true and correct to the best
of your knowledge, information and belief?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; they are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did I meet with you for a few moments before we started this
deposition and explain the purpose of the proceeding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; you did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did I ask you the same questions which we have discussed here
during the course of my questioning before the court reporter?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for providing this deposition to us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. You are quite welcome.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record between Mr. Specter and the witness, Mrs. Doris
Nelson.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Back on the record, just a minute.</p>

<p>Mrs. Nelson, I will ask you if you would sign the end of this statement here,
that it is your statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. (Signed statement referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And are you willing to waive a requirement, if it is any formal
requirement, as to the signing of this deposition?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Nelson</span>. Yes; I am.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t148"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_CHARLES_JACK_PRICE" id="TESTIMONY_OF_CHARLES_JACK_PRICE">TESTIMONY OF CHARLES JACK PRICE</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Charles Jack Price was taken at 4:50 p.m., on March 25,
1964, at Parkland Memorial Hospital, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that C. Jack Price is present to have his
deposition taken in connection with the inquiry of the President's Commission
on the Assassination of President Kennedy, which is concerned with the medical
care rendered at Parkland Memorial Hospital to President John F. Kennedy and
to Governor John B. Connally.</p>

<p>Authorization has been obtained to take the deposition of Mr. Price and he
has had access to the copy of the Executive order creating the President's
<span class="locked">Commission&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the rules relating to the taking of depositions of witnesses.
Is it satisfactory with you to have your deposition taken without having the
3-day waiting period between the request and the taking of the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you stand up, Mr. Price, and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you give before the President's
Commission and in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you state your full name for the record, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Charles Jack Price.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your official title here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Administrator, Dallas County Hospital district, comprised of
Parkland Memorial Hospital and Woodlawn Hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mr. Price, in connection with your duties at Parkland Memorial
Hospital, did you request that all of the individuals who participated in the
care and treatment of President Kennedy and Governor Connally, or at least
those who were principally concerned with that treatment, prepare and submit
reports to you concerning that treatment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; through Dr. Kemp Clark, who is chairman of our medical
records committee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where have those records been kept after submission
through Dr. Kemp Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. The records were brought directly to my office. In fact, some of
the records were written in my office and since that time have been kept in my
custody, specifically under lock and key in my desk drawer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I show you a document which has heretofore been marked as
"Commission Exhibit No. 392," and I ask you if this constitutes all of the
records of the doctors who examined and treated President Kennedy and Governor
Connally which are in your possession, that is all the records which
were made by the examining doctors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. (Examining instrument referred to.) Do you want my comments
as I go through this or do you want me to look through it and say "Yes," or
"No"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; I would like to just be sure for the record that those are all
of the records. You and I went through them the other day informally and at
that time you supplemented my records to some extent, which I will put on the
deposition record here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Perhaps, before going to Commission Exhibit No. 392, permit
me to have this photostatic copy marked Mr. Price's Exhibit No. 2.</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibit No. 2,
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I ask you if this is a photostatic copy of a letter which was
sent by Dr. Kemp Clark to Dr. Burkley, the President's private physician?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. It is.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And with that, the summary of all the treatments performed
at Parkland, which was prepared by Dr. Kemp Clark?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And below that, another summary sheet which bears the corrected
notation, with your signature over it, that the President arrived at the
emergency room at exactly 12:38 p.m., with 12:43 scratched out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, as you move through your file, permit me to also ask the
reporter to mark as Mr. Price's Exhibit No. 3, an affidavit of Ulah McCoy, and
I'll ask you if that is a copy of an original in your file?</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibit No. 3,
for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I will ask her to mark as Mr. Price Exhibit No. 4 an
affidavit of Doris Nelson and I'll ask you if that is a copy of a report in your
possession?</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibit No. 4, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Your next report is one from Dr. M.&nbsp;T. Jenkins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Professor and chairman of the department of anesthesiology.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that a copy of the document which you are looking
at here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As part of Exhibit 392?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. That's right, and my next one is the statement of Dr. W. Kemp
Clark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that the original of a copy of which appears in this
group of papers as Exhibit No. 392?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; it is. The next one that I have is the statement of Dr.
Perry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that the original of a copy of a statement which appears
in Exhibit 392?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; the statement of Dr. Charles W. Baxter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that the original of a copy which appears in Exhibit 392?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; it is; that's the statement of Dr. Carrico.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is this the copy of the original of Dr. Carrico's statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; it is; and this is Dr. McClelland's statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now show you a photostatic copy of what purports to be
Dr. McClelland's statement, and is that a copy of the original in your file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is your next report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. My next report is Dr. Bashour's report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And I show you a sheet in the group of papers marked Exhibit
392, and ask you if that is a photostatic copy of the original in your file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. My next one is the summary of Dr. Ronald C. Jones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, I'll ask you if this is a photostatic copy of the original
of the statement by Dr. Ronald Jones which is in your file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. May I see it, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>(Handed instrument referred to to the witness.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, does that constitute all of the original records concerning
the treatment of President John F. Kennedy in your file?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. With one exception&mdash;there is in the file that I have of Governor
Connally the original of the transcript of "Registration of patients," which
I furnished you a photostat of, our number being 01811.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is this a photostatic copy of that registration of patients?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. It is; and I think I reviewed it with you at the time I gave this
to you&mdash;the transverse of patients No. 2 and No. 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. No. 5 is marked John Connally and No. 2 is John F. Kennedy,
and how should that have been marked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. The first patient in the hospital was Governor Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, he should have been No. 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. So, he should have been No. 2 as shown on the transcript.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And the President should have been noted as No. 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. The President should have been noted as No. 5.</p>

<p>(Instrument referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibit No. 5, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. The simultaneous arrival at the ambulance dock would not affect
the time as shown in the corrected copy that I gave you of the arrival
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, turn if you will, to the records on Governor Connally
and I will ask you if as part of Commission Exhibit 392, we have photostatic
copies of the operative records starting, first with the operation performed
by Dr. Shaw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. I have the original of that but this is the complete medical charts
that I have here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. As to this report alone, do you have the original in that record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Here it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is this an exact photocopy of the original report prepared
by Dr. Robert Shaw, the original of which appears in your record on Governor
Connally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. It is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is this an exact photostatic copy of the report of Dr. Charles
Gregory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. There has been since this photostat was made and forwarded to
you&mdash;Dr. Gregory, prior to signing the official copy, did make some pencil corrections,
and I will be glad to have the original photostated or Xeroxed now
and give you a corrected copy if you would like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would be fine, and perhaps it would be faster just to read
those changes into our record here. However, let's pursue the line of getting a
Xerox copy.</p>

<p>Now, turning to the report of Dr. Shires, is this a true and correct photostatic
copy of Dr. Shires' report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. It is; it is a correct copy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, I show you a large group of papers which I am going to
ask the reporter to mark Mr. Price Exhibits Nos. 6, 7, 8, and 9.</p>

<p>(Instruments referred to marked by the reporter as Price Exhibits Nos. 6, 7,
8, and 9, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now show you a group of papers, and as they are being
marked, if you would take a look at them. Price Exhibit No. 6&mdash;I'll ask you
if these are photostatic copies of reports which you have made available to me
of originals which you have in your file made by various members of your staff,
concerning the events of November 22, and November 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Do you want these individually or as a group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you would identify the contents of the statement by the exhibit
number which we have put on it, starting with the first numerical designation,
would probably be the simplest. Exhibit 6 is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Exhibit No. 6 is a Xerox copy of the floor plan of the emergency
area. This is correct.</p>

<p>The Exhibit No. 7, the statement is unsigned, but this is the Xerox copy of
the summary submitted to me by my assistant, Mr. Steve Landregan.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is his position with the hospital?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. He is assistant administrator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In charge of press relations among other things?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. In charge of press relations among other things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is Exhibit No. 8?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Exhibit No. 8 is a Xerox copy of Peter Geilich's statement to me.

Bob Dutton, who is administrative assistant and is currently our evening

<p>(Instruments marked as Price Exhibits Nos. 10 through 32 at this time, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Exhibit 10 is what?</p>

is administrative aide.</p>

<p>Exhibit No. 11 is a summary of activities of Mrs. Elizabeth L. Wright, our

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are those all of the summaries of those who made reports to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Yes; they are. These are primarily the summaries of individuals
who were involved in the care of our late President, in the care of Governor
Connally, and in the care of Oswald, who were requested to make these summaries
to my office as their activities would not normally be stated on patients'
charts or in other records of the hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I now hand you Price Exhibit No. 35 and ask you if that is a
photostatic copy of the report of Dr. Charles Gregory, after it was altered in
a few minor respects as shown on the face of the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Well, if I may change this terminology?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. This is a copy of Dr. Charles Gregory's records as it appears in
Governor Connally's charts, which he corrected prior to signing the transcript.
What I was trying to say, or wanted to make clear, was that frequently in
transcribing, the medical secretaries who transcribe operative records, they
make mistakes, and I wanted to be sure that there was no suggestion that the
record was altered, when what Dr. Gregory has done was to write in corrections
that were noticed at the time he read it and signed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I understand it was transcribed, and when he reviewed it before
signing it he noticed inaccuracies in the transcription.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. That's right. This is correct. Your phraseology is much better
than mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Price.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That's all. I wanted to put all of these in the record, Jack,
to show that they are duly authenticated by the appropriate custodian of the
records.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. Well, I wanted to be sure that there was no hint that the record
had been altered here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; I understand that. I think you are absolutely right on
that. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Price</span>. All right. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t153"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MALCOLM_O_COUCH" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MALCOLM_O_COUCH">TESTIMONY OF MALCOLM O. COUCH</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Malcolm O. Couch was taken at 9:43 a.m., on April 1,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you please rise and raise your right hand and be sworn,
sir?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Be seated, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are Malcolm O. Couch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Couch, we are taking your deposition here in Dallas to
record your testimony for the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you request that an attorney be present here to represent
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We have written you about the taking of this deposition and I
assume that you have waived notice of the taking of the deposition&mdash;is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Couch, you have the right to look at the deposition and sign
it, or you can follow the general custom and rely on the court reporter and
waive the signing of the deposition&mdash;whatever you would like to do. If you
would like to sign it, you can; if you want to waive signing it, you can also.
Whatever you want to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. All right. I'll sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You want to sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. Couch, where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. 4215 Live Oak in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And how old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Twenty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And were you born in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; born in Dallas and raised in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what is your educational background? Did you go through
high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I went to Woodrow Wilson High School here in Dallas, I have
a Bachelor of Arts degree from John Brown University; and I will receive
a Master of Theology degree this May from Dallas Seminary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then plan, when you receive your Master of Theology degree,
to become a minister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I will be ordained. I don't know if I will have a church or not,
but I will be ordained.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you married, Mr. Couch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any family at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; one boy&mdash;since last Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Since last Friday? Well, congratulations to you. I assume your
wife and baby are doing well?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you major in at college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Social science.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your present occupation, Mr. Couch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Part-time television news cameraman with WFAA-TV in Dallas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say "part time," do you mean you're going to school
part <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And spending part time with WFAA-TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you been employed by WFAA-TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh&mdash;for 2 years straight. But I worked with them full and part
time, I believe, back in&mdash;starting in 1955 to 1957.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what happened in 1957?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I went to college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went to college full time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you got out in 1961?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I got out in January 1960.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. January 1960?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes&mdash;and came back to Dallas and went into graduate school
here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And when you came back to Dallas, you went to work with
WFAA-TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; no. I began going to Dallas Seminary, but&mdash;uh&mdash;I worked
for Keitz &amp; Herndon Film Studios&mdash;[spelling] K-e-i-t-z and H-e-r-n-d-o-n.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you had any other jobs since you've gotten out of college
other than those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I worked a year for Camp Elhar, as executive director of the
camp. It's a Christian camp here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this for youngsters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Boys and girls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And when did that employment take place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh&mdash;I believe it was September 1961&mdash;and ended in September
1962. I started working for WFAA in March of 1962. And I've been there
2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, part of the time while you were working with
this camp, you were also part time with WFAA-TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then when you started to work on your Masters in Theology,
you stopped working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No. I started work on my Masters when I came back from
<span class="locked">college&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Oh, I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. In January of 1960. It's a 4-year course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. Couch, I want to take you back to November 22, 1963, and ask you
whether or not you were employed by WFAA-TV at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In connection with your employment, what is the fact as to
whether or not you had anything to do with the coverage of the visit of President
Kennedy to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you just state what your duties were and what you did
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I was assigned to cover the arrival of the President at the
airport and to ride in the motorcade through town and, then, to ride with
the motorcade of the President back to the airport when he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when you were assigned, were you assigned as a reporter,
as a photographer, or in what capacity?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. As a photographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this be moving picture film or still shots, or both?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Moving only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Moving picture film only?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you at Love Field in Dallas when the President arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take moving pictures of him there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you got in the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And the motorcade proceeded, first, from Love Field toward
downtown Dallas&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the route you took through downtown Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh&mdash;roughly. It was out through the airport parkway to Mockingbird
Lane to Lemmon, down Lemmon to Turtle Creek, down Turtle Creek
to&mdash;uh&mdash;I'm not sure of those streets. I think McKinney or Cedar Springs.
I'm not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, if you aren't particularly sure&mdash;okay. What about when
you got downtown to the center of Dallas? Do you remember what streets
you went on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes. Well, we came in on Harwood and then turned right on
Main at the City Hall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you took Main to where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Main down to&mdash;uh&mdash;Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You were heading, now, west on Main down to
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About where in the motorcade was your car? Do you remember
offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh-uh&mdash;roughly&mdash;and I'm not sure&mdash;the fifth or sixth car back
from the lead car. I'm not sure which one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, do you remember, as you approached Houston Street on
Main about how fast the motorcade was going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I would estimate&mdash;uh&mdash;20 miles an hour. The speed had picked
up some. Everyone gave a sigh a relief that&mdash;uh&mdash;it was over; and one of the
cameramen, I remember, his camera broke and another one was out of film.
Everyone was relaxed. And&mdash;uh&mdash;of course, then we turned north on Houston,
and it was there that we heard the first gunshot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Before we get to the first gunshot&mdash;do you remember
who was riding in the car with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh&mdash;an best I can, it was Jimmy Darnell&mdash;Channel 5: uh&mdash;Bob
Jackson&mdash;Times Herald; Jim Underwood&mdash;KRLD-TV; and the fellow&mdash;uh&mdash;Mr.
Dillard&mdash;Tom Dillard&mdash;Dallas Morning News. And the driver of the car;
I don't know his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you sitting in the front or the back seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Sitting in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything about your position as to the way
you were sitting in the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; I was almost in the middle and sitting on the&mdash;it was a
convertible&mdash;and sitting on the back of the back seat, with my feet on the seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your feet were on the seat&mdash;and you would be sitting on the top
of the back seat?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There were three of you in the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; three in the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And were you in the middle or to the right or to the left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I was about in the middle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, as you turned north on Houston, do you remember
about how fast you were going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Well, I'd say still that&mdash;of course, allowing for the turn&mdash;that the
pace of the motorcade was about the same. We were clipping along and, as
I said, I do have films after we had turned the other corner, and you could
still see that the motorcade was moving fairly fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there any motorcycle policemen riding alongside the motorcade,
that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; there were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the names of any of those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they two-wheel or three-wheel motorcycles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Two-wheel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there one riding alongside of your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh&mdash;he was. I remember distinctly one was on my right going
down Main. They would jockey from time to time in different positions. As
I recall, on Houston, I don't remember any beside us on Houston. As I say,
they would fade back and forth. Sometimes they would be; sometimes they
wouldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, as you turned onto Houston, you said that you heard what you described
as <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. It sounded like a motorcycle backfire at first&mdash;the first time
we heard it&mdash;the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember about where your car was at the time you
heard the first noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I would say&mdash;uh&mdash;15 or 20 feet from the turn&mdash;from off of Main
onto Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Fifteen or 20 feet from the turn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. We had already completed the turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you had completed the turn, then 15 or 20 feet further on
you heard the first shot&mdash;the first noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Because, I remember I was talking and we were laughing and
I was looking back to a fellow on my&mdash;that would be on my right&mdash;I don't
know who it was&mdash;we were joking. We had just made the turn. And I heard
the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened&mdash;or what did anyone say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. As I recall, nothing&mdash;there was no particular reaction; uh&mdash;nothing
unusual. Maybe everybody sort of looked around a little, but didn't think
much of it. And&mdash;uh&mdash;then, in a few seconds, I guess from 4&ndash;5 seconds
later, or even less, we heard the second shot. And then we began to look&mdash;uh,
not out of thinking necessarily it was a gunshot, but we began to look in front
of us&mdash;in the motorcade in front of us. And, as I recall, I didn't have any
particular fears or feelings at the second shot. By the third shot, I felt that
it was a rifle. Almost sure it was. And, as I said, the shots or the noises
were fairly close together they were fairly even in sound&mdash;and&mdash;uh, by then,
one could recognize, or if he had heard a high-powered rifle, he would feel that
it was a high-powered rifle. You would get that impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where your vehicle was by the time you heard
the third shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I'd say we were about 50 feet from making&mdash;or maybe 60 feet&mdash;from
making the left-hand turn onto Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear more than three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you heard any noises, what you'd describe like a motorcycle
backfiring or firecrackers, prior to the time that you made your turn north
onto Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Well, way uptown on Main Street, a motorcycle did backfire right
beside us&mdash;and we all jumped and had a good laugh over it. And the three
shots sounded, at first&mdash;the first impression was that this was another motorcycle
backfiring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, between the first and the second shots, is there anything
else you remember doing or you remember hearing or seeing that you haven't
related here at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Nothing unusual between the shots. Uh&mdash;as I say, the first shot,
I had no particular impression; but the second shot, I remember turning&mdash;several
of us turning&mdash;and looking ahead of us. It was unusual for a motorcycle
to backfire that close together, it seemed like. And after the third shot, Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Jackson, who was, as I recall, on my right, yelled something like, "Look up in
the window! There's the rifle!"</p>

<p>And I remember glancing up to a window on the far right, which at the time
impressed me as the sixth or seventh floor, and seeing about a foot of a rifle
being&mdash;the barrel brought into the window.</p>

<p>I saw no one in that window&mdash;just a quick 1-second glance at the barrel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what building was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. This was the Texas Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At the corner of Houston and Elm in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You said it was the sixth or the seventh floor. Do you know
how many floors there are in that building&mdash;or did you know at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; I didn't know at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it look like to you he was on the top floor or next to the top
floor or the second to the top <span class="locked">floor&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. It looked like it was the top. And when you first glance at the
building, you're thrown off a little as to the floors because there's a ridge&mdash;uh,
it almost looks like a structure added onto the top of the building, about
one story above. So, you have to recount.</p>

<p>Of course, at the time, I wasn't counting, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You just remember, to the best of your recollection, that it was
either the sixth or seventh floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And when you say, "the far <span class="locked">right"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That would be the far east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The far east of what side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. The south side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not that window at which you saw
the rifle, you say, being withdrawn&mdash;first of all, could you tell it was a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes, I'd say you could. Uh&mdash;if a person was just standing on the&mdash;as
much as I saw, if the factors that did happen, did not happen, you might
not say that it was a rifle. In other words, if you just saw an object being
pulled back into a window, you wouldn't think anything of it. But with the
excitement intense right after that third shot and what Bob yelled, my impression
was that it was a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anything more than a steel barrel of a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you tell whether or not the rifle had any telescopic sight
on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any of the stock of the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any person pulling the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not, if you can remember, the window
was open or halfway open or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. It was open. To say that it was half or three-quarters open,
I wouldn't say. My impression was that it was all the way open&mdash;but that was
an impression.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anything else in the window that you remember&mdash;any
boxes or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't notice whether there was or was not&mdash;or do you
definitely remember that you did not notice any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; I didn't notice anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any other people in any other windows in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; I recall seeing&mdash;uh&mdash;some people standing in some of the
other windows&mdash;about, roughly, third or fourth floor in the middle of the south
side. I recall one&mdash;it looked like a Negro boy with a white T-shirt leaning
out one of those windows looking up&mdash;up to the windows up above him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh. Is there anything else you can remember about the
building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; that's just about the only impression I had at the moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you related what you heard Bob Jackson say. Did anyone
else say anything in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No one else said anything, that I recall, about a rifle, or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was the car when you saw this rifle being withdrawn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I'd say about 25 feet before we made the turn onto Elm. Our car
was facing the south side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Then what happened after Bob Jackson made his
exclamation and you saw what you just related?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Well, I picked up my camera. As I recall, I had it in my hand,
but it was down leaning against my legs. And I picked it up and made a quick
glance at a setting and raised it to my eye. And&mdash;uh&mdash;you can see from my
film that we're just turning the corner. We start the turn and we turn the
corner, and you can see people running. As I recall, there's a quick glance at
the front entrance of the Texas Depository Book Building. You can see people
running and you can see about the first three cars, maybe four, in front of me
as we complete the turn.</p>

<p>And then I took pictures of&mdash;uh&mdash;a few people on my left and a group, or a
sweeping, of the crowd on my right standing on the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take any pictures of the School Book Depository Building
itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Not of the south side at that moment.</p>

<p>After we went, say, 50 to 75 feet on down Elm, uh&mdash;we began to hang on because
the driver picked up speed. We got down under the&mdash;I think there's
three trestles there, three crossings underneath the&mdash;uh&mdash;at the very bottom of
Elm <span class="locked">Street&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that what they call the triple-underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>And&mdash;uh&mdash;I think, as I recall, right after we'd made the turn on Elm, one
or two of the fellows jumped out. But after we got all the way down underneath
the three trestles we finally persuaded the driver&mdash;who wasn't too anxious
to stop&mdash;to stop and&mdash;uh&mdash;we all jumped out.</p>

<p>And I ran, I guess it was about 75 yards or a little more back up to the
School Depository Building and took some sweeping pictures of the crowd standing
around. I didn't stay there long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you take any pictures of the Depository Building entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No&mdash;uh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you came back up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Not with determination. I cannot recall at this moment whether
some of my pictures I took when I ran back might have a sweeping shot of
the entrance through a wide angle lens. But not with determination. I didn't
plan to take pictures of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would these shots&mdash;these wide angle lens shots, if anyone were
standing in front of the building or leaving the building at that time, would you
be able to identify them, or would they be too far away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. They would be too far away. Possibly if the frames were blown
up, one might determine if someone was standing there&mdash;identify someone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how many minutes after the last shot would you say you
came back to take these pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Well, I'd say it took me&mdash;uh&mdash;maybe a minute and a half to get
back to there after this third shot&mdash;because we weren't but seconds getting
down underneath that underpass after we made the turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. And&mdash;uh&mdash;I jumped out and ran back. So, I'd say not over
a minute and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you started taking general sweeping shots of the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were most of the shots directed at people along the side there
as to what their reactions were, or were most of the shots directed at the
School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Mostly of the people standing around, the policemen and shots
such as this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what direction, generally, would the camera have been pointed,
and where would you have been standing when you took these pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Some of the pictures, I remember, the camera was pointing south&mdash;because
I was standing on the little knoll which is just at the foot and west
of the Depository Building, where the little park area begins. There's a sidewalk
that runs between the Book Depository property, I would assume and
the park. And I was standing on that little sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And your camera was pointing south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Pointing south. That's right. Now, after I had taken I don't
know how many feet of film of people standing around, I&mdash;uh&mdash;we&mdash;I think
there was one or two other fellows with me and who they were, now, I can't
remember; they were photographers&mdash;we stopped a car that was going by with
a boy in it&mdash;a young boy of about high school age&mdash;and asked him to take us out
to Parkland. And as the car started off, I started my camera and I have a
sweeping shot moving west from about&mdash;uh&mdash;maybe the middle of the Book
Depository Building from ground level on past the park area&mdash;a sweeping shot
with the car moving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And that's about it insofar as the School Book Depository Building
is concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Well, no. After we got out to Stemmons&mdash;they'd set up a roadblock
just as you entered Stemmons Expressway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. We jumped out of the car and I took, I believe it was, a 2-inch
lens shot of the Book Depository Building of the west wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of the west wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Not of the front entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any particular reason, Mr. Couch, why you didn't take your
first pictures of the School Book Depository Building itself when you say you
saw a rifle being withdrawn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Well, uh&mdash;as best I can recall, the excitement on the ground of
people running and policemen "revving" up their motorcycles&mdash;and I have a
real nice shot of a policeman running toward me with his pistol drawn&mdash;the
activity on the ground kept my attention. The reason I did not stay and
take pictures of the Depository Building&mdash;which I had originally intended to
do when I got out of the motorcade&mdash;was that&mdash;uh&mdash;another cameraman from
our station, A.&nbsp;J. L'Hoste&mdash;[spelling] L-'-H-o-s-t-e&mdash;he came running up and&mdash;uh&mdash;when
he ran up, why I said, "You stay here and get shots of the building
and go inside&mdash;and I'm going to go back&mdash;I'm going to follow the President."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Was he also a moving picture cameraman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he at the time you made this statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh&mdash;he was standing on that little sidewalk that runs between
the&mdash;I met him on the little sidewalk between the Book Depository property
and the beginning of the parkway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be the west side of the Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right; that's right. It's there that I saw the blood on
the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, you say you saw blood on the sidewalk, Mr.
Couch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. This was the little walkway&mdash;steps and walkway that leads up
to the corner, the west corner, the southwest corner of the Book Depository
Building. Another little sidewalk, as I recall, turns west and forms that little
parkway and archway right next to the Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did this appear to be freshly created blood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how large was this spot of blood that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh&mdash;from 8 to 10 inches in diameter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did people around there say how it happened to get there, or not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; no one knew. People were watching it&mdash;that is, watching
it carefully and walking around it and pointing to it.</p>

<p>Uh&mdash;just as I ran up, policemen ran around the west corner and ran&mdash;uh&mdash;northward
on the side of the building. And my first impression was that&mdash;uh&mdash;that
they had chased someone out of the building around that corner, or
possibly they had wounded someone. All the policemen had their pistols
pulled. And people were pointing back around those shrubs around that west
corner and&mdash;uh&mdash;you would think that there was a chase going on in that
direction.</p>

<p>Again, the reason that I didn't follow was because A.&nbsp;J. had come up, and
my first concern was to get back with the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This pool of blood&mdash;about how far would it have been north
of the curbline of Elm Street as Elm Street goes to the expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I'd say&mdash;uh&mdash;well, from Elm Street, you mean, itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes. This is from that part of Elm Street that goes into the
expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I'd say&mdash;uh&mdash;50 to 60 feet, and about 15 feet or 10 to 15 feet from
the corner of the Texas Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It would have been somewhere along that park area there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything else you noticed by this pool of blood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No. There were no objects on the ground. We looked for something.
We thought there would be something else, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There was nothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, this A. J.&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. L'Hoste. That's "L" apostrophe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes; I have that. I have made a note of the spelling, along with
the phonetic sound.</p>

<p>Do you know if he got any pictures of the south side of the School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; I don't recall what he got&mdash;as I recall&mdash;now, I may be wrong,
this is a guess&mdash;that he did not take any pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He did not take any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know of anyone that took any pictures of the south side
of the School Book Depository Building, particularly the front entrance of the
building, shortly after the assassination?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; only what I have seen in Time magazine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Only what you've seen in Time magazine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, did you ever know or hear of Lee Harvey Oswald before
any of this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever met Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There is an FBI report that states that you had heard hearsay
statements that someone had seen Jack Ruby emerge from the rear of the Texas
School Book Depository Building around that time. Did anyone ever tell
you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes. Uh&mdash;where I first heard it, I could not now recall; but&mdash;uh&mdash;the
story went that&mdash;uh&mdash;Wes Wise, who works for <span class="locked">KRLD&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Yes&mdash;saw him moments after the shooting&mdash;how many moments,
I don't know&mdash;5 minutes, 10 minutes&mdash;coming around the side of the building,
coming around the east side going south, I presume.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever talk to Wes Wise as to whether or not he actually
saw this, or is this just hearsay?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; I didn't. This is just hearsay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this: Is there any observation, other than hearsay,
that you have about this entire sequence of events that you have not
related here?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; I can't think of anything. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In this same FBI report of an interview with you, it states
that&mdash;and by the way, I did not show this to you when you first chatted about
this&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh-huh; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There is a statement as to the time sequence&mdash;that you heard,
first, two loud noises about 10 seconds apart. And you related here that it
would have been 5 seconds apart or less. Do you remember whether or not
at the time you gave your first statement to the FBI you said 10 seconds or
would you have said about 10 seconds or would you have said less than 10
seconds&mdash;or could this be inaccurate, as sometimes happens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I don't recall now. Ten seconds is not a reasonable time; even
if I said "about 10 seconds." I know a little bit more about timing than that.
We have to time our stories pretty close&mdash;and that's a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what's your best recollection now as to the amount of time
between shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Well, I would say the longest time would be 5 seconds, but it
could be from 3 to 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And would this be true between the first and the second shots
as well as between the second and third&mdash;or would there have been a difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. As I recall, the time sequence between the three were relatively
the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mr. Couch, shortly before we commenced taking this
deposition, you and I met for the first time. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then we came to this room and we chatted for a few minutes
before we started taking a formal deposition. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, is there anything that we talked about pertaining to the
assassination that in any way differs or conflicts with the testimony that you
have just given?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not I questioned you in great
detail about each question or whether or not I just asked you to relate the
story to me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. You asked me to give general highlight impressions before we
began.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then, after you gave those to me, we started taking the
deposition&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you repeated on the deposition what we had talked
about&mdash;is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right&mdash;in more detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can think of at this time which,
in any way, would affect the investigation of the assassination of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No; I cannot think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we want to thank you very much for taking your time
to come down here. We know that you're a busy man. We also would like
you to convey our thanks to station WFAA-TV for allowing you to come down
here. We appreciate it very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Couch, we're going back on the record again. You're still
under oath&mdash;and I'm not quite sure whether I asked this question, but I had
better ask it again.</p>

<p>When you saw this rifle being withdrawn. About how much of it could you
see at first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. I'd say just about a foot of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And in what direction was the barrel pointing at the time you
saw it being withdrawn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Approximately a 45° angle westward&mdash;which would be pointing
down Elm Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Down Elm Street as it goes into the expressway there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And when you say "45° angle" would that be up or down, or are
you referring to the angle of incline, or the angle of west and south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. The angle of incline&mdash;from a horizontal position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. So, you would estimate about a 45° angle downward
pointing in what would be a southwesterly direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. Uh&mdash;westerly direction. From looking straight on at the building,
one could not tell the&mdash;uh&mdash;angle, whether it was more southward or
not. In other words, something sticking out the building, I couldn't tell. It
was not&mdash;it did not appear to me that it was sticking straight out the window,
so to speak.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes. Is there anything else that you noticed about the gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Couch</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Thank you. I just wanted to make sure I got that
on the record.</p>

<p>The testimony of Tom C. Dillard was taken at 9:15 a.m., on April 1, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. State your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Tom C. Dillard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you stand and raise your right hand, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span> (Complying).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony given before this Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. My name is Joseph A. Ball. I am staff counsel for the President's
Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy. You have already been
requested to be present have you <span class="locked">not&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. By letter; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By letter which you received last week?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I am a photographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I might state the purpose of questioning you is to ask you questions
as to any knowledge you might have as to the facts concerning the assassination
of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, at Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I understand. My occupation is journalist; I am chief photographer
of the Dallas Morning News, do some aviation writing but my primary
job is head of the photographic department and, of course, I do outside work for
the paper on photographic work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I'm 49.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What has been your general education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. High school, very few college courses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. High school and very few college courses.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I didn't go to school. I graduated Fort Worth, from the old
Central High School, went to the Officer Candidate School in the Military and
Air University.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been with the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. The Dallas News since 1947 and I was with the Star Telegram,
went to work in 1929.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you been a photographer for the papers all these years?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Well, yes; of course, the first years, when I was started at the
age of 15, I was a copy boy and did various reporting and whatever we could do
on the paper. I was 15 when I started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, you were in the motorcade who followed President
Kennedy, weren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. That is correct. I understand our car was about number six
in the line.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you meet the President at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you rode in the motorcade from Love Field into Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was in your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I remember Jim Underwood, he's an announcer for KRLD-TV
and cameraman, acting as a cameraman that day; and Bob Jackson of the Times-Herald,
cameraman; and Couch with our TV station, Channel 8, and did you
have information his name is Couch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's right; and the man that <span class="locked">drove&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Channel 5&mdash;Darnell, I think his name is, and the driver of the
car which I don't believe I remember his name. It was a Chevrolet convertible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your car was about sixth, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. From the President's car. We lost our position out at the
airport. I understood we were supposed to have been quite a bit closer. We
were assigned as the prime photographic car which, as you probably know,
normally a truck precedes the President on these things and certain representatives
of the photographic press ride with the truck. In this case, as you
know, we didn't have any and this car that I was in was to take any photographs
which was of spot-news nature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you turned from Main Street onto Houston, was the President's
car in sight at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. No; and the whole parade, the whole trip to town, I could only
distinguish the President's car on very few occasions in high rises in the
ground, when we got on hills. It was difficult because the people in the cars
ahead of me were sitting on the backs of cars which pretty well covered the
President's car for me. We had a very, very poor view of the President's car
at any time from the time the parade started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me whether or not the President's car had made the
turn off Houston Street when your car turned north on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. It had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. No; I won't say it had. I think it had because, like I say, I
could never see the car very well. I believe it had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you sitting in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I was sitting in the right front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was in the front seat with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Oh, I don't remember; I think Jackson was sitting beside me&mdash;no;
I believe Jackson was sitting in the back. I don't remember what our
locations were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you know you were in the right front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear something unusual as you were driving north on
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes; I heard an explosion which I made the comment that I
believe, in my memory, I believe I said, "My God, they've thrown a torpedo"
and why I said "torpedo", I don't know. If you wish, I'll go <span class="locked">ahead&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go ahead with your story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Well, then I later estimated, immediately later, estimated, oh,
4, about 3 or 4 seconds, another explosion and my comment was, "No, It's
heavy rifle fire," and I remember very distinctly I said, "It's very heavy rifle
fire."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many explosions did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I heard three&mdash;the three approximately equally spaced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the best estimate of the position of your car with reference
to the turn at Main and Houston when you heard the first explosion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Perhaps, oh, just a few feet around the corner and it seems we
had slowed a great deal. It seems that our car had slowed down so that we
were moving rather slowly and perhaps just passed the turn when I heard
the first explosion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anyone in your car say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Well, after the third shot I know my comment was, "They
killed him." I don't know why I said that but Jackson&mdash;there was some running
comment about what can we do or where is it coming from and we were
all looking. We had an absolutely perfect view of the School Depository from
our position in the open car, and Bob Jackson said, "There's a rifle barrel up
there." I said, "Where?" I had my camera ready. He said, "It's in that
open window." Of course, there were several open windows and I scanned
the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. The School Depository. And at the same time I brought my
camera up and I was looking for the window. Now, this was after the third
shot and Jackson said, "There's the rifle barrel up there," and then he said it
was the second from the top in the right-hand side, and I swung to it and there
was two figures below, and I just shot with one camera, 100-mm. lens on a 35-mm.
camera which is approximately a two times daily photo twice normal lens and
a wide angle on a 35-mm. which took in a considerable portion of the building
and I shot those pictures in rapid sequence with the two cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You shot how many pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Two pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With one camera or two different cameras?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Two different cameras&mdash;one daily photo, not extreme daily
photo, but twice the normal lens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say your cameras were ready? How were they ready?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Hung around my neck and held in my hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You brought them up and focused and shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Well, on the whole ride, I had been watching the tops of buildings
and watching for any signs or anything unusual which, of course, is a
newsman's chore on a parade like that. We were badly&mdash;in a very bad position
from our viewpoint to cover anything on the parade, so we were all, as any
news photographer is, rather tense when he is covering a Presidential or an
affair of that sort and he is trying to get whatever pictures possible and watching
for every possibility, and so we all tried for a number of things. Incidentally,
the only unusual thing in the parade that I noticed was the President&mdash;I understand
the President stopped his car at Lemmon and Loma Alta, which is out
in the near suburbs of Dallas, as I understand, at the request of a sign that said,
"Mr. President, stop and shake hands with us." I jumped out of the car&mdash;it
was a convertible with the top down&mdash;and tried to run to get pictures of it but
by that time the parade started and I was unable to get up that far.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you shot these two pictures of the Texas School Book
Depository Building, how far were you from the building, would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. From the window or from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the building. That would be, I suppose, a measurement
along the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I would say it was just before we reached the corner of Elm
and Houston Streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were south of Elm and Houston, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About how far? Well, perhaps as a photographer, you can give
me a more accurate estimate this way; tell me how far you think your camera
was from the upper windows when you shot that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Oh, it wasn't over 50, 60 yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything in the windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't see a rifle barrel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did see some figures or forms in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Only in the windows which was the windows below.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many forms did you see in the windows below?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I saw two men in the windows, at least the arched windows. I
saw them in my picture. I was making the picture my eyes were covering.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw them as you were taking the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I may have; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember if you saw two or three figures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did see some figures and you cannot be accurate?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your car stopped where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I remember, we were stopping and starting down Houston
Street or moving very slowly while this shooting was going on, and I know we
came around the corner of Houston and Elm and saw people lying on the ground
down the hill on the sides of the lawns there in the plaza, and I jumped out of
my car. The car stopped then and I got out and I don't know what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after you go out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Well, I made a picture of cars moving into the sun under the
underpass, somebody chasing the car and I looked at the situation in that area
and saw absolutely nothing of the Presidential car or anything that appeared
worth photographing to me at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Perhaps 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Another car, Chevrolet convertible, of the party came by with,
I assume, dignitaries in it and I jumped on the back of it and we started&mdash;I
told them, of course, who I was and we started out Stemmons Expressway
toward the Trade Mart and I explained to them what I knew and tried to hold
onto the back of that car at rather high speed. I never saw the Presidential
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any idea or any impression as to the source of the
explosions&mdash;what direction it was coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes, I felt that, at the time, I felt like it was coming from a
north area and quite close, and I might qualify I have had a great deal of experience.
I am a gun nut and have a great number of high-powered rifles at
home, so I know a little bit about guns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have had experience with rifles?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes, I have shot a great deal, so I am familiar with the noise
that they made in that area. We were getting a sort of reverberation which
made it difficult to pinpoint the actual direction but my feeling was that it was
coming into my face and, in that I was facing north toward the School Depository&mdash;I
might add that I very definitely smelled gun powder when the
car moved up at the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I very definitely smelled it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By that you mean when you moved up to the corner of Elm and
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes; now, there developed a very brisk north wind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was in front of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes, it's rather close&mdash;the corner is rather close. I mentioned
it, I believe, that it was rather surprising to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did you mention it to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Bob, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Bob Jackson?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yeah, Bob and I were talking about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You developed your pictures, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or did you turn them over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I printed them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You printed them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes, I don't remember whether I developed that roll or not.
I may have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you do that the same day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes, immediately thereafter, shortly after I came back from the
hospital.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you examined the pictures that you had taken&mdash;those two
pictures you had taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I <span class="locked">have&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. There was never any question in my mind that there was
more than or less than three explosions which were all heavy rifle fire, in my
opinion, of the same rifle. The same rifle fired three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you still have the two negatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes; of these [indicating]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have them in your possession?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. At the Dallas News; they're in a box kept locked in the managing
editor's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Suppose we could do this. I have pictures here which you can
identify but perhaps it might be a little closer to the source if we do this.
Could you make me up two prints for your deposition from those negatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Well, I guess so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Off-record discussion.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You will endorse your signature on each copy as being a print
made from your negatives, is that satisfactory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Suits me; I could get it notarized.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't need to do that because we can attach it as a copy to
this deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I could sign these; of course, you want that other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We have two here. First of all, you made one picture with a wide
lens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you made a picture with a short lens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Long lens&mdash;short and wide are the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A short, wide lens and one long lens. Now, I show you two pictures
and I mark one "A" and mark one "B." Look them over and tell me
whether or not those are prints from the picture that you made that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. These are prints from one of the negatives I made on November
22.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you will furnish us two prints, one from each negative
which we will mark as "C" and "D" and you will initial them, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you mind initialing the "A" and "B" and we will make it part
of this deposition&mdash;just on the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. One of them will be the same picture as these two. These two
are prints from one of my negatives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That will be all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I have another negative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which you will make a print of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. If you wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Make up a print from each negative. Now, you made a statement
to Agent Keutzer of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the 25th of
November 1963, didn't you, or thereabouts?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And at that time, you told him that you first heard a noise which
sounded like a torpedo, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes, I <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Off-record discussion.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell him that hearing another sound similar to that, you
realized it was gunfire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you heard the third shot. Now, the statement says that upon
hearing the third shot, the car in which he was riding was stopped almost in
front of the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. My car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear Bob Jackson of the Dallas Times-Herald exclaim
"I see a rifle; it's up in the open window".</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Jackson pointed to the Texas School Book Depository located
at Elm and Houston Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you looked up at the building and you did not see a rifle
protruding from any window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. I did not see a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did take two photographs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you still have those negatives?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. That's true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you ever in a position where you could see anyone leave the
Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Briefly, only in the very short time, perhaps a period of 3 or 4
minutes, that I was in the general area. After the third shot, I was probably
not there over 3 or 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody leave the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. To my knowledge; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's everything. Will you waive signature on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. Sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dillard</span>. That's all right, glad to help.</p>

<p>The testimony of James Robert Underwood was taken at 11:25 a.m., on April 1,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Underwood, will you stand up and be sworn?</p>

<p>(Complying.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before
this Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. My name is James Robert Underwood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I am the assistant news director of KRLD-TV and radio in
Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, you were in the motorcade, the Presidential
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes, sir; I was three cars behind the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was in the car with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. There was a photographer from channel 5, WBAP-TV, whose
name is James Darnell, and a photographer from the Dallas Morning News&mdash;I
know his name but I can't think of it right <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tom Dillard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes; Tom Dillard, and a photographer from the Dallas
Times-Herald whose name is Bob Jackson, also a photographer from WFAA-TV
and I do not know his name. I heard it but I don't remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was a driver, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes; the driver I later found out was a member of the
department of public safety.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are a photographer, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes, sir; I wear many hats in my business but one of which
is news photographer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have your camera with you that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes, sir; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your experience; where were you born; where did you go
to school; how did you get to get the experience that fit you for your present
job? Just in your own words, tell me something about yourself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I was born in Oklahoma City, Okla., in 1922; I served in the
Marine Corps from 1940 until 1943, almost 4 years, and after that I attended the
University of Tulsa and after that I worked&mdash;I began working in radio as an
announcer while I was going to college. When I got out of college, I went to
Corpus Christi, Tex. That was about 1947 and I became program director and
news director of a radio station in Corpus Christi and I stayed there until 1950
when I went to a station in Jacksonville, Fla., where I was also program director
and news director, and in 1953, I came to Dallas, and I worked for a year and
a half for WFAA-TV as an announcer, then I freelanced in television and radio
from September of 1954 until November&mdash;and I have to count for a minute&mdash;6
years this November that would be until November 1958 when I went to
work for KRLD-TV and Radio News and shortly thereafter I became assistant
news director but I earned part of my living, I still freelance in television which
is all freelance in television and I have a regular job which entails every type
of reporting, including photography which I enjoy doing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the day of the assassination, you were in the motorcade with
these men you mentioned and you think your car was third behind the Presidential
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes; and I thought it was six or seven. I shot sound on
film of the President's arrival and Vice President's arrival at Dallas Love Field
the morning he came in on the 22d and then I took off the rather cumbersome
sound on film equipment and took my hand camera because I had an assigned
place in the motorcade and I could not tell out there because of the many people
I could not tell what position we were in. I could not see that far ahead to
determine exactly where we were in the motorcade, although I knew we were in
the front of it. The motorcade stopped once on the way downtown, this was
briefly, and I jumped over this side&mdash;we were in a convertible&mdash;and ran toward
the President's car and I was aware of the crowd and the motorcade immediately
started and I ran back to the convertible, not wanting to be left, and looking
afterward at the films that I took there, I could then count the cars there. I
realized we were three behind him, according to my movies we took. When
we turned onto Main Street downtown and headed west toward the scene of
where the assassination took place, either the regulator or the mainspring in
my camera broke and I was without a camera. I knew that we had two men,
at least two men on the parade route who were on the street and would be filming
the motorcade as we came by and I hoped to exchange my broken camera for
one of theirs because I knew I could make more use of the one that would operate.
The only problem was we went down Main Street so rapidly it would have
been impossible to get anything from someone standing on the street and at
Main and Record one of our men was stationed and I tried to holler at him my
camera was broken and I wanted to switch and I started to and there was no
point in it because we passed there that rapidly. I thought it was the fastest
motorcade that passed through a crowd; this was really moving, as far as I was
concerned. Then, we came to the scene where the shots were fired. Do you want
me to go on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the time you turned, tell me what you observed after you
made the turn at Main and Houston to drive north on Houston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. After we turned onto Houston Street, the car I was in was
about, as far as I can remember, about in the middle of the block or a little bit
north of the center of the block, which is a short block, when I heard the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Between Main and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes; between Main and Elm, closer to the Elm intersection,
Elm and Houston intersection, when I heard the first shot fired. I thought it
was an explosion. I have heard many rifles fired but it did not sound like a
rifle to me. Evidently must have been a reverberation from the buildings or
something. I believe I said to one of the other fellows it sounds like a giant
firecracker and the car I was in was about in the intersection of Elm and Houston
when I heard a second shot fired and moments later a third shot fired and I
realized that they were by that time, the last two shots, I realized they were
coming from overhead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You realized they were coming from overhead and that would be
from what source?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. That would be from the Texas School Book Depository
Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It sounded like they were coming from that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes, sir; the last two. Now, the first was just a loud explosion
but it sounded like a giant firecracker or something had gone off. By
the time the third shot was fired, the car I was in stopped almost through the
intersection in front of the Texas School Book Depository Building and I leaped
out of the car before the car stopped. Bob Jackson from the Herald said he
thought he saw a rifle in the window and I looked where he pointed and I saw
nothing. Below the window he was pointing at, I saw two colored men leaning
out there with their heads turned toward the top of the building, trying, I suppose,
to determine where the shots were coming from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What words did you hear Bob Jackson say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I don't know that I can remember exactly except I did hear
him say words to the effect that "I saw a rifle" and I looked at that instant and
I saw nothing myself. If he saw a rifle, I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that point when you looked, where was your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Our car was in the intersection, in the intersection of Elm
and Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had it made the turn yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. It had partially made the turn or had just begun to make
the turn. Frankly, I was looking up and around and I saw at the same time
people falling on the ground down the street toward the underpass and my first
impression was some of these people falling to the ground had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did your car stop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Our car stopped and the minute it stopped I leaped out of
the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was your car when it stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Right in the intersection, perhaps just past the intersection,
turned onto Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you get out before the car parked along the curb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes, sir; the minute it stopped, I leaped over the side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I left my camera in the car, the camera that was broken,
and ran as fast as I could back toward the man we had at Record and Main in
order to get a camera. There I was without a camera; the only thought I had
was to get a camera.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you get one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes; I ran the full block back to Main Street and our man
there, name of Sanderson, was running down Main toward Houston. He was
running to meet me, although he didn't know what was happening and that my
camera was broke. Suddenly, motorcycles and sirens had been turned on police
cars and were all headed toward Main. I met him just around the corner on
Main past Houston and grabbed his camera and said, "Someone had been
shooting at the President." I didn't know this but I assumed it happened. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
took his camera and got back to the scene. When I got back to the scene, most
of the people in the area were running up the grassy slope toward the railway
yards just behind the Texas School Book Depository Building. Actually, I
assumed, which is the only thing I could do, I assumed perhaps who had fired
the shots had run in that direction. I recognized at least a dozen deputy sheriffs
running also in that area&mdash;it seems to me that many, and I ran up there and
took some films and they were running through the railroad yard and they
very quickly found nothing and I was having, frankly, a hard time breathing
because I had done more running in those few minutes than I am used to doing.
I gasped out to a couple people&mdash;I don't know who they are&mdash;that I thought the
shots came from that building and one of the fellows in the car with me said
they had seen a rifle barrel in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This group of men were deputy sheriffs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. For the most part, yes; I don't think I could recall&mdash;Lemmy
Lewis I see in my mind, but I am not sure Lemmy was there. This was a
kaleidoscope of things happening. In my business, you need to make a quick
appraisal of what is happening if you are going to shoot pictures of it. I was
confused and out of breath and unbelieving of what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go from the grassy slopes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I went from the railroad yards&mdash;actually, I was back in the
track area&mdash;I went immediately with these men at a run to the Texas School
Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. The front entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes; and I ran down there and I think I took some pictures
of some men&mdash;yes, I know I did, going in and out of the building. By that time
there was one police officer there and he was a three-wheeled motorcycle officer
and a little colored boy whose last name I remember as Eunice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Euins?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. It may have been Euins. It was difficult to understand when
he said his name. He was telling the motorcycle officer he had seen a colored
man lean out of the window upstairs and he had a rifle. He was telling this to
the officer and the officer took him over and put him in a squad car. By that
time, motorcycle officers were arriving, homicide officers were arriving and I
went over and asked this boy if he had seen someone with a rifle and he said
"Yes, sir." I said, "Were they white or black?" He said, "It was a colored
man." I said, "Are you sure it was a colored man?" He said, "Yes sir" and
I asked him his name and the only thing I could understand was what I thought
his name was Eunice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he about 15?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I couldn't tell his age; looked to me to be younger. I would
have expected him to be about 10 or 11 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I stayed in front of the building; actually, I stayed in the
intersection of Elm and Houston and took movies of police arriving and fire&mdash;and
I think some fire equipment arrived on the scene, one firetruck or two firetrucks,
I'm not sure, and I just shot some general film on the area. I have since
searched that film to see if I could see any face in it that would have been
important to this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Leaving the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. Yes; but I haven't found any except that of officers arriving
and just people generally in the area; none of it, though, that you could&mdash;I
spent several days at this, I guess during January when things had calmed
down. I was on the side street of the building, around the front of the building
and in the intersection for the next 10 minutes, then I went across the street
to the courthouse and phoned several news reports to C.B.S. in New York and
described what was taking place in the building at that time. There were firemen
with ladders in front of the building and officers running in and out and
they cordoned off the building and kept the spectators out of the building, but
there was quite a time lapse between the time the shots were fired and the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
anyone checked the building. The main effort was to run to the railroad yards
instead of the School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all. Mr. Underwood, this will be typed up and you
can waive signature if you wish or you can sign it if you wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. I don't have to sign it. I will waive signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I was in the office of the district clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you later leave and go out into the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. About 12:25, we left the office and went out to the corner of
Houston and Elm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. That's Record and Elm&mdash;that's Commerce, isn't it, Jim?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Underwood</span>. What's that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. What is the street just north of the courthouse&mdash;that's Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Well, actually, the courthouse is&mdash;I suppose our office would
be considered on Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you left your office, you walked on what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Walked on Elm to Houston, rather than Record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To what corner of Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. That would be the corner of the courthouse. Do you want the
direction of the intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, where was it? Southeast, northwest corner of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. It's the northwest corner of the courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The northwest corner of the courthouse&mdash;it's the southeast corner
of the intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Southeast corner of the intersection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you watched the President pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I was at that location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which corner of the intersection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. The southeast corner of the intersection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the Texas School Book Depository Building from
where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. It would be on the northwest corner of the intersection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Directly across?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have a good view at that point of the south exposure
of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I had a very good angle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President's car pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And just tell me in your own words what you observed after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. As I observed the parade, I believe there was a car leading
the President's car, followed by the President's car and followed, I suppose, by
the Vice President's car and, in turn, by the Secret Service in a yellow closed
sedan. The doors of the sedan were open. It was after the Secret Service
sedan had gone around the corner that I heard the first report and at that
time I thought it was a backfire of a car but, in analyzing the situation, it
could not have been a backfire of a car because it would have had to have been
the President's car or some car in the cavalcade there. The second shot followed
some seconds, a little time elapsed after the first one, and followed very quickly
by the third one. I could not see the President's <span class="locked">car&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. That's right; I couldn't even see the Secret Service car, at
least I wasn't looking for it. As the report from the third shot sounded, I looked
up. I had previously looked around to see if there was somebody shooting firecrackers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
to see if I could see a puff of smoke, and after I decided it wasn't a
backfire from an automobile and as the third report was sounded, I looked up
and from the far east corner of the sixth floor I saw a movement in the only
window that was open on that floor. It was an indistinct movement. It was
just barely a glimpse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. That would be the far east <span class="locked">window&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. On the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. I
turned to Miss Mitchell and made the statement that if those were shots they
came from that window. That was based mainly on the fact of the quick movement
observed in the window right at the conclusion of the report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you give me any better description than just a movement?
Could you use any other words to describe what you saw by way of color or
size of what you saw moving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. If I were asked to describe it, I would say that it was a
profile, somewhat from the waist up, but it was a very quick movement and
rather indistinct and it was very light colored. It was either light colored or
it was reflection from the sun. When the gun was found, or when a gun was
found, I asked the question if it was white, simply because if it was a gun I
saw, then it was either white or it was reflecting the sun so it would appear
white or light colored.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any boxes in that window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes, directly behind the window, oh possibly three feet or
less, there were boxes stacked up behind the window and I believe it was the
only place in the building that I observed where boxes were stacked just like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any boxes in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. No, I didn't see any. There wasn't any boxes in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stay there at that point very long, the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. No; as I said. I couldn't observe the President's car and I
had no actual knowledge that he had been shot, so realizing that we should
get the information almost immediately from the radio which had been covering
the motorcade&mdash;we had been listening to it prior to going on the street&mdash;I
thought our best information would come from that, so we went, Miss Mitchell
and I, went back into the office. I have no way of knowing the time. I would
say it was a minute or&mdash;I would say a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you heard the shots, did you return to the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The movement that you saw that you describe as something light
and perhaps a profile from the waist up, you mean it looked like a profile
of a person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. That was&mdash;I had a hard time describing that. When I saw
it, I automatically in my mind came to the conclusion that it was a person
having moved out of the window. Now, to say that it was a brown haired,
light skinned individual, I could not do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you tell whether it was a man or woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You made a report to the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the
10th of January?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Before I ask you about your report, did you have any impression
as to the source of the sound, from what direction the sound came, the sound
of the explosions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes; I do. As I mentioned before, the sound, I thought it
was a backfire in the cavalcade from down the hill, down the hill toward the
underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean west on Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes, and that was a little confusing and in analyzing it later,
evidently the report that I heard, and probably a lot of other people, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
officers or the FBI, it evidently was a sound that was reflected by the underpass
and therefore came back. It did not sound to me, ever, as I remember,
the high-powered rifle sounding. It was not the sharp crack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What caused you to look up at the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. The sound had to be coming from somewhere; the noise was
being made at some place, so I didn't see anyone shooting firecrackers or anything
else and I thought "this idiot surely shouldn't do such a thing," but if
they were, where were they, and if they were shots, where were they coming
from, and that caused me to search the whole area on Houston Street and in
front of the Texas Depository on Elm Street and then up and that's how I
happened to be looking up at the time, rather than observing things in the
street, probably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see any smoke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In your remark to Mary Ann Mitchell, did you say "if those were
shots, they came from that window"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is what you reported to the FBI agent, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes, I suppose; at that time, I was still not absolutely sure
that they were shots and that's why I said if they were shots. I was basing
that, I am sure I was basing that mainly on the fact of this quick movement
that I observed. In other words, if I were firing the shots, I would have
jumped back immediately at the conclusion of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Later on, did you go back in the street and talk to someone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to a deputy sheriff?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Allen Swett.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I told him to have the men search the boxes directly behind
this window that was open on the sixth floor&mdash;the window in the far east
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell him anything of what you had seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I don't think so. I think I was so amazed that I could walk
across the street and walk up to this building that was supposedly under
surveillance and the man had not been&mdash;I say "the man"&mdash;there had not been
anyone apprehended.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long was it after you heard the shots that you walked up
to Allen Swett and talked to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. My guess is it could have been anywhere from 10&ndash;20 minutes.
My guess would be around 15&ndash;20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the statement you made to the FBI agent, he reports you said
you walked to the Texas School Book Depository where you contacted Deputy
Sheriff Allen Swett and advised him of the movement you had seen in the
sixth floor window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I must have said something about the movement. I did tell
him to search those windows, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you in your own words give us your memory of what you
told Allen Swett?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I would probably have said, as I remember it, that to have
the men search&mdash;have someone search the boxes directly behind that window.
I had seen some movement directly after the shots. That was, I think, all I
said. I did not&mdash;there was no conversation and at the conclusion of my statement,
he directed several men up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever go in the building yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. I did not and I still have not been in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all, Mr. Crawford. Thanks very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Thank you, Mr. Ball.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Incidentally, will you waive signature on this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Crawford</span>. Yes; I will.</p>

<p>The testimony of Mary Ann Mitchell was taken at 2:30 p.m., on April 1,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Miss Mitchell, will you stand up, please, and be sworn; hold up
your right hand.</p>

<p>(Complying.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will be giving before
this Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes; I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Mary Ann Mitchell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I am a deputy district clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For Dallas County?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. For the county of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work is that; do you work in the court?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. No; I work in the main office of the clerk of the district
courts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me something about your background&mdash;where were you born,
where were you raised, what schools did you go to?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I was born in Roanoke, Tex., which is in Denton County,
about 30 miles north of here; graduated from high school in Denton in 1942.
I went to college for 2 years at Arlington and moved to Dallas and came to
work here in June of 1944. I have held several secretarial and stenographic
type jobs before I went to work for the county of Dallas and that was in
1950 and I have been there since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Since 1950, you have been with the county with the Clerk of the
District Court of Dallas County?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November 1963, about noontime, where were you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. About noontime?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I was in the office about noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Working?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Working, which is in the basement of the Records Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you leave there some time, leave the office to see the parade
that morning?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes, as a matter of fact, I went up to see the parade since
we are in the basement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you leave the building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. At possibly 12:25 or 12:27, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whom were you with?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I left the office with Jim Crawford.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I went out onto the street and down to the corner of the
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That means you would be on what corner of what streets?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I went out the Elm Street entrance of the building and I
was on the corner of Elm and Record&mdash;I'm sorry, Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which corner?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I knew you were going to ask that and I decided it's probably
the northwest corner. I am not good at directions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's put it this <span class="locked">way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. It's the corner diagonally across the intersection from the
Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The Texas School Book Depository is on the northwest corner;
that would put you on the southeast corner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes, sir; I was thinking about which corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The northwest corner of the building and the southeast corner of
the intersection, is that right?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you near the curb when you were standing?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes; I was on the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President's car pass?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me in your own words what you noticed and what you heard
after the President's car passed; what did you see and what did you hear?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Well, the President's car passed and, of course, I watched
it as long as I could see it but, as I remember, immediately behind it was a
car full of men with the top down and quite a few of them were standing and
I assumed they were Secret Service men, so after the car turned the corner
and started down the hill, I couldn't see over the heads of the standing men
for very long, so then I turned back to watch the other people in the caravan,
whatever you call it, and probably about the time the car in which Senator
Yarborough was riding had just passed, I heard some reports. The first one&mdash;there
were three&mdash;the second and third being closer together than the first
and second and probably on the first one my thought was that it was a firecracker
and I think on the second one I thought that some police officer was
after somebody that wasn't doing right and by the third report Jim Crawford
had said the shots came from the building and as I looked up there then we
realized that if the shots were coming from that building there was bound to
have been somebody shooting at the people in the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard Jim Crawford say something about if they were shots&mdash;what
were his words exactly?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Well, I'm not sure that he said&mdash;I think he just said, "Those
shots came from that building," just assuming that everybody could have figured
out by then that they were shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look at the building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody in any of the windows?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I don't remember. I understand there were some porters
that were leaning out of the fifth floor windows but I don't remember whether
I saw them or not. I know where I thought he was pointing and where I was
looking I couldn't see anybody so I never was sure which window he thought
he was pointing to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he pointing?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I am almost sure that he was because I was trying to figure
out exactly where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that, if anything?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Well, looked back around at the crowd, I'm sure, because I
expected to see the Secret Service men and police escorts just start pouring
everywhere when we decided what the shots were and then looking at the
people that were falling on the ground and started milling around and then I
went back in the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you did not come out again?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. No; I did not come out again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you, at any time, say anything like "oh, no, no" in reply to
what Mr. Crawford said?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Well, yes, I'm sure I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In reply to what remark of his?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Oh, I don't know. I don't know possibly it was when he
was talking about the shots coming from the building but I don't remember
if he said anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, if you excuse me just a minute, let me look in my notes
here. These are the notes from which I refresh my memory here.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. I can remember what I was saying and doing better than
I can what other people were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there anything else that you remember that you said?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Besides when I said something about "oh, no, no" or "oh,
my goodness" or "oh, my God" or whatever I said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes; I said, "This is no place for us, let's get out of here."
I thought if we would get out of their way, the police officers could work
better.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's when you left?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. That's when I left and he came with me. I had locked the
office and I had the key to the office still in my hand so I could get back in
very fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all. Do you want to look this over and read it and
sign it or do you want to waive signature?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Either way. We were out of the office such a short time
because we had spotters in the building so we would know when the parade
was coming and we could run out. We had so many people in the building
who worked there upstairs and they called us when it was coming so we
could go outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. If you wish, we can waive your signature; the young lady will
write it up and send it back to Washington, is that all right with you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Mitchell</span>. Yes; that's fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all. Thank you very much for coming up today.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; but I plan to go back later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the fall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is your husband working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He's got a new job. He is working for Life Circulation Co.,
or corporation, I don't know which.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What does he do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He is a telephone solicitor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For magazine subscriptions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is your husband a high school graduate or not?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you meet while you were going to high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old is your husband, by the way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He is 18.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When were you married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We were married May 16, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you will be having your anniversary in another few weeks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know if I got on the record your residence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. 1131A Phinney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you originally from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You lived here all your life?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Except the summer we lived in Oregon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is your husband originally from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He is from Corpus Christi.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Has he lived in Texas all of his life, do you know, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No. He has lived in Texas and Kansas and Oregon and
Arizona, and I don't know where else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did he live in Kansas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 2 years ago, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what he was doing when he was in Kansas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He was going to school and working, I don't know what as.
I think he worked in a cafe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know how far your husband got through school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, his credits are all mixed up. I think he lacks one or
two semesters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of completing high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You said you were going back to school. Does he plan to keep
working, or does he plan to go back to school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He plans to go back to school sometime. I'm not sure when.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To finish high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. And college. Go to college, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, has he ever made any application for college yet, that you
know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't know for certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know, or has he ever said to you that he has?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He told me he was going to make an application at Oregon
State, and&mdash;but I don't know if he ever made any applications anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you categorize yourself insofar as your grades that you got
in high school, would they have been C's, B's, or A's, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. A's and a few B's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was your major?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. English.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you had one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I was going to major in English, Math, and Spanish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All three?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. In high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about your husband? Did you know what he was majoring
in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Math, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know about what his grades were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Varied.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He made A's and B's in some subjects, and he made C's and
D's, I think, in other subjects.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this before you were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. He says he has an A average, but I don't believe him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why? Did he tell you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. He told me that, because I saw a few of his report
cards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I saw a few of his report cards and they weren't all A's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For what years would that have been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't remember. I just saw them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Rowland, I want to get just a little bit more background
information. After you were married, were you employed at all or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I worked for Sanger Harris during the Christmas season
this year, this past year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Other than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, I worked for about 3 days for a friend of mine at a
dry goods store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about your husband? What jobs has he held since you
were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Let's see, he worked at West Foods in <span class="locked">Salem,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this after you were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to Oregon after you were married?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. We were married May 16, and we went to Oregon
about, we left the next day, and we got there about the 21st or something like
that. He worked at West Foods in Salem; Exchange Lumber in Salem; Myron
Frank in Salem, and after we moved back down here <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you move back down to Texas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. In September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were these jobs that he held of the same type, or did he work
first at one place and <span class="locked">then&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. One place and then another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular reason why he changed jobs, that you know of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, the first job was dirty and difficult and he didn't like
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was he doing then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He was working in a mushroom plant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think he was carrying them out, I don't know exactly what
he was doing with them. Then he worked at Myron Frank which was a department
store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he do there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He worked as a cook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is he a good cook?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Pretty good cook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you better than he is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I am not a very good cook.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Anyway, he worked there. It was a temporary job when he
got it, and when the time, when the period was up, he got another job as a, what
do you call it, a shipping clerk at the Exchange Lumber Co., and he worked
there until a few days before we left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went back to Dallas sometime in September?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did your husband do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't remember the first job. He worked for Pizza Inn as
a cook and he worked for Civic Reading Club as a telephone solicitation job,
and he worked for P.&nbsp;F. Collier Co., as a salesman, and then he worked, now he
is working for Life Circulation Co. as a telephone solicitor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did he have these jobs? The first one, how long did
he work there, approximately?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't know. I think he worked at Pizza Inn for about two
and a half months, maybe. And he worked for P.&nbsp;F. Collier for about 4 weeks, I
think, but he didn't do anything there. I mean he wasn't very successful. And
he worked for Civic Reading Club about 2 months, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And now he is working for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Life Circulation Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you working at all during the fall, or what were you doing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He worked for Sanger Harris during the Christmas season,
too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. That is the only job. That is all I have worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you going to school at all in the fall, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; at the beginning of the fall we were both going to
school. But we couldn't quite afford to stay, and so because his job was only
<span class="locked">part-time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So did either one of you quit or both?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Both.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when did you both quit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roland</span>. In November, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this have been before or after the shooting of President
Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roland</span>. Well, we stopped going before the assassination, but we
officially dropped afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let me ask you this. On the morning of the assassination,
where were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roland</span>. We were on Houston Street near the drive-in entrance of the
records building between Elm and Main Streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before that, where had you been that morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At my mother's home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had been at your mother's home that morning from about
when to when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, we were living with my mother, and so from that
morning when we got up, and we walked part <span class="locked">way&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you leave your mother's home, about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think it was about 10 or 10:30, and we caught the bus. We
walked a few blocks toward town, because we thought we would be too late to
come see him, and we caught the bus, I don't know exactly what time it was
when we got to town, but I think it was about 11:30, and about 15 minutes before
the motorcade came by is when he told me about the man up in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, you caught a bus near your mother's place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The Ledbetter bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time do you think you caught the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roland</span>. I don't know, about 10:30, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did that get you downtown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 11. I don't know exactly. I don't remember times
very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let me ask you this. After you got downtown, what did
you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We just stood there waiting for the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well. I will kind of work backwards. How long did you stand
waiting for the motorcade before the motorcade came by, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 25 minutes, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did it take you to get from the bus stop?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The bus stop was right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you figure if the motorcade came by at around 12:30, you figure
you got down to the spot at 12 or 12:05?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you got down to that spot at 12 or 12:05, how many minutes
prior to that time do you think you got on the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You figure it might have been a 45-minute bus ride?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would have meant that you would have got on the bus around
11:15 or so?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how long you waited for the bus before you
got it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We were walking while waiting for the bus, and it was about,
I guess, 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you figured you walked around about 20 minutes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you figured you would have left your mother's home shortly
before 11?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are nodding your head yes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, did you notice anything while you were watching,
waiting for the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We saw an airplane. Now, while we were waiting for the
motorcade, well, there was a man across the street who fainted in the park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were standing now on what street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. On Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be on the east or the west side of Houston?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. West side&mdash;east side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. East side. In front of what building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. In front of the records, at the side of the records building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know any particular spot that you were standing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We were standing near the drive-in entrance. There is an
elevator there, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Near the elevator that comes out of the ground?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you said you noticed a man across the street fainted.
Anything else that you and your husband noticed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, my husband and I were talking about Mr. Stevenson's
visit and the way the people had acted, and we were talking about security
measures, and he said he saw a man on the sixth floor of the School Book
Depository Building, and when I looked up there I didn't see the man, because I
didn't know exactly what window he was talking about at first.</p>

<p>And when I found out which window it was, the man had apparently stepped
back, because I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which window was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It was the far left-hand window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you face the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It would be the window to the south side of the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be on the eastern part of the south side or the western
part of the south side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. West.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be the farthermost west window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; the farthermost west pair of windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The farthermost west pair of windows. What did your husband
say to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, we assumed that it was a Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But what did he say, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He told me that he saw a man there who looked like he was
holding a rifle, and that it must be a security man guarding the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can remember that he told you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when he told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Nothing. I just generally agreed with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean "generally agree"? Did you see the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I didn't see the man, but I said I guess that was what
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean you agreed that he must have been a security officer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice you are not wearing glasses now. Do you wear glasses?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. Yes; sometimes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you near-sighted or far-sighted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. Near-sighted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any trouble looking at this window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. No; I saw the window plainly, and I saw some people hanging,
looking out of some other windows, but he said that the man was standing
in the background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say about how far back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. I think he said about 12 feet, I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say how much of the man he could see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. Apparently he could see at least from the waist up, because
he said that the man was wearing a light shirt, and that he was holding the
rifle at a port arms position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether the man was white or colored?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. He said he thought he was white.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether the man was an old man or a young man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. He said a young man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether the man was fat or thin?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. He said he was either tall or thin. I mean, if he was tall,
he could have been well built, but if he was not very tall, then he was thin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not the man had on a hat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. I don't think he said whether he did or not. But if he had
seen a hat, I think he would have said so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say what color hair the man had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how many minutes was this before the motorcade came
by that he saw this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. About 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything else about the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. Not that I remember, except that he was wearing a light
colored shirt or jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything about any other people in any other windows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, did you notice any other people standing in any other
windows or leaning out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. I am not sure if I did at that moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Later on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. I saw some people either earlier or later looking out the
windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything about any of the people you saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. Some of them were colored men. I don't think I saw any
women.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any white men?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where you saw any of these Negro men?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. On a lower floor, about the fourth floor, I think, and nearer
the center window. The windows nearer the center.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On some floor lower than the sixth floor, which you think was
the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. About the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you and your husband comment about these other men?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. We may have said something about there being other people
watching, I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you particularly watch the sixth floor because of the fact
that you had seen or your husband had seen a person on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bowland</span>. We looked at it for a few minutes, but we didn't look back,
and when we heard the shots, we didn't look back up there. I grabbed his hand
and started running toward the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this now. From the time that you saw or your
husband said he saw a man on the southwest part of the sixth floor, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
you say was about 15 minutes before the motorcade came by, how much longer
did you look back up at the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Just about 2 or 3 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. About 2 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean about 2 minutes after that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So that would be up to a time of about 13 minutes before the
motorcade came by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever look back at the building after that period of time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I may have glanced at it, but I don't remember looking
back for the purpose of seeing the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, or any man there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Any man there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were you doing from the 13 minutes on before the motorcade
came until the time it came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Just talking and looking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you looking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At the street and the other people, and we talked about
some men who were carrying cameras.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you were standing watching the motorcade or standing
watching the street scene, do you remember if your husband was to your
right or to your left? Was he closer towards the School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; he was to my left most of the time, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Just standing there talking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Talking to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not if he ever looked back at the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I wouldn't know for certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever tell you he was looking back at the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever notice him looking back at the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he generally looking at you when he was talking with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not necessarily. He might have been looking around at the
street or at the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Or at anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else at that place then that you specifically remember
before the motorcade came by? Did your husband say anything about seeing
anyone in the building, or did you talk any more about the man with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I really don't remember very much about what happened
afterward. I mean it was <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I mean between, in the 15 minutes preceding the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I remember hearing on the radio that the President was
passing Ervay Street. It wasn't on our radio, somebody else's radio, and that
is about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, what color dress were you wearing that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Oh, my, I am fairly certain I was either wearing a green suit
or red and gray suit, but I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of coat, if you were wearing a coat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I was wearing a brown coat, brown suede coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what your husband was wearing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He was wearing a plaid sports jacket, probably. I am not
sure which sports jacket, but I think he was wearing a plaid sports jacket that
was blue and had some black and grey in it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he wearing any overcoat over the sports jacket?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Oh, no; I wasn't wearing that brown coat, I don't think. I
think I was wearing an olive coat. He probably had his overcoat, but it is
more of a raincoat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you wearing gloves?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he wearing gloves?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you wearing a hat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; a scarf.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he wearing a hat, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He might have been. He wears one sometimes. Sometimes
he doesn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you remember about what happened prior
to the time the motorcade came by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, will you please tell us what happened as the motorcade
went by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, Mrs. Kennedy was wearing a blue&mdash;I mean a pink or
maybe a rose&mdash;it was either pink or rose dress or suit, I couldn't say, because
she was sitting. She had a pink hat or rose, the same shade as her dress.</p>

<p>And I remember noticing that the President's hair was sort of red, that is all.
They were facing mainly toward the other side of the street and waving, and as
they turned the corner we heard a shot, and I didn't recognize it as being a shot.
I just heard a sound, and I thought it might be a firecracker.</p>

<p>And the people started laughing at first, and then we heard two more shots,
and they were closer than the first and second, and that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear all told?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you said you heard two more shots that were closer than
the first and second, what did you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I meant the second and third were closer than the first and
second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Rowland, did you have any idea where the shots came from
or the sound?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, the people generally ran towards the railroad tracks
behind the School Book Depository Building, and so I naturally assumed they
came from there, because that is where all the policemen and everyone was
going, and I couldn't tell where the sounds came from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you just started over after them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did your husband go with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I grabbed his hand and he couldn't go anyplace else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you running or walking over there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. It wasn't a very fast run, but it wasn't a walk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk about anything, about the man that you had seen
in the window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No. But he was reluctant to start running, and he might
have been looking up there, I don't know. But we didn't say anything about
the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got over there? Where did you run to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. To the colonnade over on the north side of Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As Elm Street goes down to the freeway?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We walked towards the railroad tracks, but the policeman
wouldn't let anybody go further.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We just stood there and he was speculating on what had
happened, and he was looking around at everything, and the policeman inspected
a Coke drink bottle that was there, and my husband found a pen,
very cheap ballpoint pen that you get as an advertisement, and he gave it to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
the policeman, and then he mentioned the man he had seen in the School Book
Depository Building, and then the man took us to the records building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did your husband mention this to? Was this some police
officer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I am not certain. The first man he mentioned it to was wearing
plain clothes, and we didn't see him again, I don't think. And then there
were some other men who took us to the building. I don't know who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do when you got to the building? Did you
stay with your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was questioned in the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear what your husband said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you describe what went on in the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. When we first came in, we went into an office that had glass
windows around it. There was a man sitting there with a child. I think it was
a boy and he said that he had seen the President shot and he said that&mdash;he didn't
say there were three shots, I think he said there was one, or maybe he said
there were more than three, but he didn't say there were three shots.</p>

<p>Then we went out into an open area in the building, a fairly open area, and
there were some reporters in there, and they started asking us questions which
we didn't answer, because mainly we didn't have time.</p>

<p>Then we were taken into a very small office and a lady took his written
statement and my statement, and there were three other people who came in,
three other witnesses who come in.</p>

<p>There were two young men together, and one young lady who came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, when you gave your statement to the police and
your husband gave his statement to the police, or to whoever the people were
taking the statement, do you remember what your husband said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. Do I have to tell you again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, did he say substantially what you said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that he said that you haven't related here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I believe he may have said that the man had dark hair.
Either he said that the man had dark hair, or he didn't see what color the man's
hair was. And he said just about the same thing I said here, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, anything else that was said there by your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't remember anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did your husband at that time say whether or not he had
kept any watch on the window of the School Book Depository Building after
he saw this man with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He didn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not he had seen any other people in the
windows of the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I am fairly certain that he said there were other people
looking out the windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not there were any other people on that
same floor looking out the windows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I am not certain whether he said or not. But I know there
weren't any other people on that floor looking out the windows that could be
seen from the outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I mean I know they couldn't be seen from the outside, because
I couldn't see them. I am nearsighted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you keeping any watch on the building after the time you
saw the man with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you look up at that building from time to time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, I didn't pay any special attention to the building, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
I am sure I glanced at the building more than once afterwards, because I
can't just stand and stare in one direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you mean you were just glancing at that building as you
were glancing at other places?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you were glancing at that building, do you remember
whether you glanced at it, say, within 10 minutes prior to the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't remember. But most of the windows on that floor
were closed, and the people who were looking out usually were looking out at
an open window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any people look out of any open windows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how many did you see all told, if you can remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roland</span>. Two or three, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any more than two or three looking out of windows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not any of those that you saw looking
out of windows were looking out of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. They weren't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They were not? Were they on any floor higher than the sixth
floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they all on floors lower than the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did your husband state in the presence of you at any time while
he was giving any of these statements on the afternoon of November 22,
whether or not he saw any people looking out of the building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did he say he saw them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He didn't say exactly where he saw them, but the windows on
the floor above the sixth floor were all closed, and I think they were never
open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. So they wouldn't have been on the seventh floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not he saw any people looking out of any
other windows on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He didn't say, I don't believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say what floor? He didn't say whether he did or did not,
is that your testimony, or did he say that he did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't believe he said whether or not he saw any other
people on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say about what he saw? Do you remember about
how many people he said he saw looking out of the windows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't believe he said any certain number of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything that he said about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He just said that there were some other people looking out
of some windows in the same building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he specifically locate them in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, is there any other thing that your husband said in
your presence that afternoon pertaining to this School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay over there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We were there until about 2:00 or 3:00, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Then we left and walked around town and tried to get a
newspaper, and before we left, we knew that the President was dead.</p>

<p>From that&mdash;for a while, we were in a room alone with a lady who came
in to testify, and said that she had seen a blond man carrying a rifle in a
rifle bag, and he said that probably it couldn't have been the man he saw
because the man he saw was dark-haired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did this woman say where she was&mdash;where she saw the blond-haired
man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I believe she said in front of some sporting goods store.
I am not certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say where the sporting goods store was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Some place downtown, but I don't remember exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it in the immediate vicinity of the School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Meaning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Within a block of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say when she saw a blond-haired man carrying a rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I am not positive exactly what time she said, but it was
before, she said, she heard about the President being shot, and she came
back there to tell them she had seen a man earlier carrying a gun in a rifle case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. She had seen some man, that had blond hair, downtown carrying
a gun in a rifle case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is all she knew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, I believe that is all she knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can add?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, there were two young men who came in too, and they
said something about seeing a man carrying a rifle downtown. I believe they
also said he was a blond man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. That he was over 6 feet, and he was well built, from what
they said, and that is all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did your husband say about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He didn't comment, I don't think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything else that took place while you and your
husband were over giving your statements, that you can think of right now?
Anything else that your husband said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. We left and we walked in an easterly direction and we
went to a coin shop and looked around for a while, and then I went home and
he went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he working?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At the Pizza Inn on West Davis. He caught a bus and went
to work, and I caught a bus and went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened? When did you see him next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, wait a minute, I didn't go home very soon. The bus&mdash;there
was poor bus service, and I didn't go home until quite, until about 9:00,
I think, and I saw him the next morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had he been contacted at the Pizza Inn later that night, do
you know, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, were either you or he contacted at any time during
that day by any law enforcement agency?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't think we were contacted the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would have been Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Saturday, I know we weren't. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When were you next contacted, either on that Saturday or that
Sunday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think so. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you how many times after November 22 were you
contacted by some law enforcement agency?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Me personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You personally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I spoke to law enforcement officers about three or four times,
I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how many times in November? Once on the 22d?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. And we were contacted once Sunday morning at the
Pizza Inn during November. I think it was the next Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The 24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. And we were contacted one morning, I am not positive,
I think it might have been that Saturday, the following Saturday, the 23d&mdash;the
Saturday following the assassination, at my mother's home, and I am not
positive how many times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you present at any of these times that your husband was
contacted?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you present, for instance, on the Sunday morning, November
24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what your husband said at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He repeated the statement he had made in the&mdash;well, the
police officers brought a written statement and asked him if that was in general
what he had to say, and he said, "Yes," and they asked him specific questions
about it and he answered them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything else that was said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything that your husband said that was not on that
written statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I am not positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember him saying anything&mdash;do you remember him
telling the police officer that the statement was correct, or do you remember
him telling them anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; he signed. There might have been a change or two in
the statement and then he signed it and said that he verified that it was correct,
to the best of his knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell the police officer anything that was not on that statement
that should be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he asked whether or not he saw any other people in any other
windows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't believe he was specifically asked that question.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell any of the police officers that he saw any people in any
other windows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I am not certain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not he told them, the police officers, that
there was any other person on the sixth floor that he saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He never said that there was another person on the sixth
floor, in my presence, that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you present when he was with the police officers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Sunday morning, November 24th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you personally with him throughout the time that he was
with the police officers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And he, in your presence, never said that he saw anyone on the
sixth floor other than the man with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No. He never said in my presence that there was another
man other than the man with the rifle on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is a little bit like there has been asked a negative question and
you don't know whether to answer yes or no to the question, is that right, Mrs.
Rowland?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now were you present at any subsequent interviews that your
husband had with any law enforcement agency?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I was present when Mr. Howlett came to ask, to tell him that
he should go to Washington, that he wanted him to go to Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did your husband say to that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He said, "Okay."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he talk to you, by the way, about his testimony when he got
back from Washington? Did he talk to you about his testimony in front of the
Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Has he ever talked to you about his testimony? Before you came
down here, for instance, has he talked to you about what he said in front of
the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Going back to his interview with the police, do you know how
many interviews he had after the one on Sunday, November 24?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I think he had about six or eight interviews in all. I mean
all inclusive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that include the one with Mr. Howlett telling him to go to
Washington?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes. I am not positive of the number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. From November 24 to November 30, that
week, do you know how many interviews he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, has he ever told you that he had seen anyone else on the
sixth floor other than this man with the gun that you described in the southwest
corner window?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Has he ever told you that he told anyone else that he saw anyone
else on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did your husband ever complain to you that he was being questioned
too much by any law enforcement agency?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't think so, not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever complain to you that any statement that he gave
was not taken down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any complaint that he ever made to you about law
enforcement agencies?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not about the law enforcement agencies, but in the Dallas
Morning News on February 11, 14&mdash;11th or 14th, they had an article in there,
and they had some things in the article that he didn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Like what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Like that the man was good looking. I mean, because he
said he couldn't recognize the man. That is what he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Apart from what the Dallas Morning News said, then, did he
have any complaints about his contacts with either the FBI or Secret Service
or the sheriffs office or the city police of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. None that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Rowland, you made a statement toward the beginning part
of this deposition that your husband said that he had all A's, but that you knew
different, because you had seen the report card.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. He said he had an A average.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But that you knew different?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Well, he may have had an A average overall A average, but
some of his cards didn't have A's altogether.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you mentioned that he had A's and B's and some C's and
some D's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. The one I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what years those would have been for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometimes some people are prone to exaggerate more than others,
and without in any way meaning to take away from the testimony of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
husband as to what he saw in the building at the time, just from your general
experience, do you feel you can rely on everything that your husband says?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I don't feel that I can rely on everything anybody says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, this is really an unfair question for me to ask any wife
about her husband, and I am not asking it very correctly, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. At times my husband is prone to exaggerate. Does that
answer it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I think it does.</p>

<p>Is there anything else you want to add to that, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Usually his exaggerations are not concerned with anything
other than himself. They are usually to boast his ego. They usually say that
he is really smarter than he is, or he is a better salesman than he is, something
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you care to add?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Again, I apologize for any&mdash;for in any way trying to embarrass you
or anything, but your husband did see a man on the sixth floor and it is
important for us to try and find out everything we can to test his accuracy
as to what he saw, and so this is why I have been asking these questions.</p>

<p>You and I have never met before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not that I ever remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When we did meet, I immediately brought you in here and we
started taking your deposition under oath, isn't that true?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We didn't chat about anything before we started taking your
deposition, did we?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you mentioned the fact that the newspaper misquoted your
husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other time when you know that he complained about
being misquoted insofar as the facts of the assassination are concerned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. When we had our first written statement, the police officer,
I believe he was an FBI agent, restated everything we said, and it was typed
in the&mdash;in that form. But he also asked if it was, if that was the general
meaning of what we had said, so he didn't complain. But anyway, it wasn't
in his exact words, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything inaccurate about the statement?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No; I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did your husband ever make any complaints to you about anything
inaccurate in any statements that he had given?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. If he did, I don't remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can think of that might in any
way be relevant to this whole area of inquiry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Did you or your husband rather, ever see
a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald on television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. I saw either the actual shooting on television of Mr. Oswald
or either a rerun, and I saw his picture in the newspaper, but I don't know if
my husband ever saw it or not.</p>

<p>But he did&mdash;we heard on the radio the afternoon of the assassination that
Lee Harvey Oswald had been accused of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you or your husband know anyone by the name of Lee Harvey
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you or your husband know Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Not to my knowledge, I never have known him, and I don't
think he has. If he has, he never told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we certainly appreciate your coming down here. You have
been most helpful, Mrs. Rowland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
One final thing. You have an opportunity to either come back and read what
the court reporter has, the transcript after it is typed, and sign it, or else you
can waive coming down and taking the time to read it and sign it, and have it
go directly to Washington.</p>

<p>Do you care to come down to read it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you like to, you have every right to do so.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You will be contacted then, and you can come down and read it
and make any corrections, if you like.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes; could I, other than making corrections have it rewritten
in better English?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, I'm afraid my English at times isn't very good, Mrs. Rowland,
and we have to let it go the way it is right now. By corrections, I mean anything
where you feel the court reporter might not have accurately transcribed
the words that you and I said here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If either one used bad grammar, the English teachers will have
to look down their noses at us.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Rowland</span>. Thank you.</p>

1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I'm an auditor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Dallas County auditor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where do you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I work at 407 records building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where is the records building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. That's in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. It covers one square block area bounded by Main, Record, Elm,
and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you, Mr. Fischer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Twenty-five.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes&mdash;high school, yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What high school did you go to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. W.&nbsp;W. Samuell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you complete high school or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you participated in any postgraduate work since you graduated
from high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I've taken courses toward an accounting degree at Arlington
State College, Arlington, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are these correspondence courses or have you actually attended
the school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No; I've attended the school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you attend that school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I attended 1 year, full time and I attended 1 year, night school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what have you done since after you left Arlington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. All of the time since I've left Arlington, I've been working for
the Dallas County auditor&mdash;with the exception of a correspondence course
that I'm taking at the present time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, by that, you mean you're still working full time but you
are taking the correspondence course also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been working for 4 or 5 years for the auditor's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Five years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mr. Fischer, I want to take you back to November 22, 1963,
and ask you if you remember watching or getting ready to watch, the Presidential
motorcade on that day? Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And were you with anyone else, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Bob Edwards&mdash;he works in the same office that I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does he work there now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No; he doesn't. At the present time, he's attending a college
in Oklahoma but I don't remember the name. It's in Tahlequah, I believe.
I don't know the name of the college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could that be&mdash;I think it's [spelling] T-a-h-l-e-q-u-a-h?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I think that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when did you and Mr. Edwards leave your place of employment
on that day to watch the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Oh, about&mdash;well, let's see. We got off for lunch at a quarter
of twelve and Mr. Lynn, our boss, said that we could take&mdash;go ahead and go on
down the street after we got through with lunch, in other words, don't come
back to the office after lunch. Just go on down the street and watch the parade.
Everybody was due back after the parade was over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. So, I went to lunch at a quarter of twelve, and ate until about
12 o'clock, and then Bob and I went down to the street&mdash;oh, 5 or 10 after 12&mdash;and
we stood, at first, on Main Street right outside the records building. And
then about 12:15 or 12:20, we were trying to find a place where we could see
better, so we walked down to Houston and then one block down Houston to
Elm and stood there until the parade came by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, do you know when you got to corner of Houston and Elm&mdash;approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. About 12:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 12:20?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where were you standing on the corner of Houston and
Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. We were standing right on the curb&mdash;uh&mdash;on the southwest
corner of Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you with relation to that lagoon that's there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, that lagoon is rather long. We were standing in front
of it, across the sidewalk. I believe it's the curb and the sidewalk and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
little bit of grass, and then the lagoon. And we were standing right on the
curb there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were standing on the curb at about the point where the actual
curve of the curb is at the intersection&mdash;or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I'd say where the curb starts to curve. Because, when the
shots were fired, we looked around at the motorcade and couldn't see it&mdash;because&mdash;uh&mdash;of
the people that were standing along the curb there. We just
couldn't see it. Had we been on further around, we could have just looked
down the street and seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So, you would have been really standing on the curb which would
be the west curb of Houston Street, just where it starts to make the curve to
go onto Elm there. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, would you describe what you saw as you were standing
on that curb?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. About 10 or 15 seconds before the parade&mdash;first car of the
parade came around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now what corner is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Of Houston and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Which would have been the first time we could have seen any
of the cars because of the building&mdash;about 10 or 15 seconds before the first
car came around that corner, Bob punched me and said, "Look at that guy
there in that window." And he made some remark&mdash;said, "He looks like he's
uncomfortable"&mdash;or something.</p>

<p>And I looked up and I watched the man for, oh, I'd say, 10 or 15 seconds.
It was until the first car came around the corner of Houston and Main. And,
then, when that car did come around the corner, I took my attention off of
the man in the window and started watching the parade. The man held my
attention for 10 or 15 seconds, because he appeared uncomfortable for one,
and, secondly, he wasn't watching&mdash;uh&mdash;he didn't look like he was watching for
the parade. He looked like he was looking down toward the Trinity River
and the triple underpass down at the end&mdash;toward the end of Elm Street.
And&mdash;uh&mdash;all the time I watched him, he never moved his head, he never&mdash;he
never moved anything. Just was there transfixed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what window did you see the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. It was the corner window on Houston Street facing Elm, in
the fifth or sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what side of the&mdash;first of all, what building was this you
saw him in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. The Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what side of the building would the window have been in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. It would have been&mdash;well, as you're looking toward the front
of the building, it would have been to your right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, the building itself has four sides&mdash;a north, east, south, and
a west side&mdash;the entire sides of the building. Would this have been the north,
south, east, or west side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. It would have been the south side&mdash;the entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, on that south side of the building&mdash;now, was
it the center part of the south side, the east part of the south side, or the west
part of the south side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. The east part of the south side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, with reference to the east corner of the south side there&mdash;would it have
been the first window next to that corner, the second, the third, or the fourth&mdash;or
what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. First window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the east corner of the south side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything about the man? Could you describe
his appearance at all? First of all, how much of him could you see?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I could see from about the middle of his chest past the top of
his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. He was in the&mdash;as you're looking toward that window, he was
in the lower right portion of the window. He seemed to be sitting a little
forward.</p>

<p>And he had&mdash;he had on an open-neck shirt, but it&mdash;uh&mdash;could have been a
sport shirt or a T-shirt. It was light in color; probably white, I couldn't tell
whether it had long sleeves or whether it was a short-sleeved shirt, but it was
open-neck and light in color.</p>

<p>Uh&mdash;he had a slender face and neck&mdash;uh&mdash;and he had a light complexion&mdash;he
was a white man. And he looked to be 22 or 24 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything about the color of his hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. His hair seemed to be&mdash;uh&mdash;neither light nor dark; possibly
a light&mdash;well, possibly a&mdash;well, it was a brown was what it was; but as to
whether it was light or dark, I can't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he have a thick head of hair or did he have a receding hair-line&mdash;or
couldn't you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I couldn't tell. He couldn't have had very long hair, because
his hair didn't seem to take up much space&mdash;of what I could see of his head.
His hair must have been short and not long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, did you see a full view of his face or more of a profile of it,
or what was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I saw it at an angle but, at the same time, I could see&mdash;I believe
I could see the tip of his right cheek as he looked to my left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, could you be anything more definite as to what direction
he was looking at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. He looked to me like he was looking straight at the triple
underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Down what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Down Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Toward the end of Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As it angles there and goes under the triple underpass there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see whether or not he was holding anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No; I couldn't see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see any other objects in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. There were boxes and cases stacked all the way from the bottom
to the top and from the left to the right behind him. It looked&mdash;uh&mdash;it's possible
that there weren't cases directly behind him because I couldn't see because of
him. But&mdash;uh&mdash;all the rest of the window&mdash;a portion behind the window&mdash;there
were boxes. It looked like there was space for a man to walk through
there between the window and the boxes. But there were boxes in the window,
or close to the window there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see any other people in any other windows there that
you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I couldn't see any other people in the windows. I don't remember
seeing any others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By this, do you mean that you are sure there were none, or that
you just do not remember seeing any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I don't remember seeing any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, after you saw the man, then the motorcade turned onto
Houston from Main&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see the man again in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever look back at the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I never looked back at the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, could you describe what happened as you watched the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
motorcade turn? First, about how fast did the motorcade appear to be going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. When the motorcade passed me, it was&mdash;uh&mdash;the driver was in
process of making the wide turn there from Houston to Elm, and he was
going very slow. I'd say, uh&mdash;10&ndash;15 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, the motorcade&mdash;the limousine made the wide turn and&mdash;uh&mdash;they
went out of our view just as they began to straighten up onto Elm
Street because there were people standing along the curb all the way around&mdash;and
that's when the limousine went out of my view and I started watching
the other cars behind the Presidential limousine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, as I looked around to watch these other cars, I heard a
shot. At first I thought it was a firecracker. And&mdash;uh&mdash;everybody got quiet.
There was no yelling or shouting or anything. Everything seemed to get
real still. And&mdash;uh&mdash;the second shot rang out, and then everybody&mdash;from
where I was standing&mdash;everybody started to scatter. And&mdash;uh&mdash;then the third
shot.</p>

<p>At first, I thought there were four, but as I think about it more, there must
have been just three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At first, you thought there were four shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you said the first one you thought was a firecracker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the second one? Did you think that was a firecracker,
too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No. When the second shot rang out. It was too much like
the first to be a firecracker. I have heard high-powered rifles fire before.
The&mdash;uh&mdash;first shot fooled me, I think, because of the sound bouncing off the
buildings. But the second shot was too much like the first and it was too
loud&mdash;both shots were too loud to be a firecracker. And I knew it was a shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you had any experience with high-powered rifles before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Very little; but I have shot several.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the third shot? Did you think that was a firecracker
or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No; I knew it was a shot, too. I knew someone was shooting
at something. Uh&mdash;it didn't&mdash;it still didn't dawn on me that anyone would
try to shoot at the President, but I knew that somebody was shooting at something.
I didn't know whether it was a real pistol or a real rifle&mdash;but I knew
somebody was shooting a firearm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did the shots appear to be coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. They appeared to be coming from just west of the School Book
Depository Building. There were some railroad tracks and there were some
railroad cars back in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And they appeared to be coming from those railroad cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, that area somewhere. From where I was standing, I
couldn't see the cars themselves until I had run across the street and up the
hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The shots seemed to be how far apart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. That's hard to say. I've been thinking about that. And-uh&mdash;I'd
guess&mdash;3 to 4 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that between the first and the second or between the second
and the third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Between both. As far as I can remember, the shots were evenly
spaced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else about the shots that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No&mdash;only that they were very loud.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about the man in the window that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. (Pausing before reply.) No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. What did you do or see or hear after you hear the
shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. After the second shot we, Bob and I both, started running down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the sidewalk on Elm Street, on the south side of Elm, and there were still people
that were milling around and shuffling around. When the second shot broke, like
I say, a lot of people started running, some people still stood but a lot of people
started running. Uh&mdash;and then when the third shot went off, we just almost
reached the curb and then just as the limousine went under the triple underpass,
we got to the street&mdash;Elm Street&mdash;where we could actually see&mdash;uh&mdash;well&mdash;where
the shots had gone, and&mdash;uh&mdash;we ran across the street where there were a man,
his wife and two children laying on the ground. Now, that was on the north side
of Elm Street about halfway between Houston and the triple underpass and we
ran down there where this man and his wife and two boys were. Someone was
helping them up off the ground, and the man said at that time that the President
had been shot.</p>

<p>And, after that, we stood there for 10 or 15 seconds and then we ran up to the
top of the hill there where all the Secret Service men had run, thinking that
that's where the bullets had come from since they seemed to be searching that
area over there. They jumped off&mdash;out of cars and ran up the side of the hill
there and onto the tracks where these passenger&mdash;freight cars were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. (Pausing before reply.) No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after that, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. After that, we went back up to the building where we work&mdash;the
records building&mdash;and went on upstairs to the office. And that's where Bob
and I separated and&mdash;he had some things to do&mdash;I think he had some stuff that
had to go down to another office and he left. After we got up there, he got some
paper and then left. I stayed there for a little while <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, first of all, about when did you get back to the records
building do you feel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Uh&mdash;it must have been 5&mdash;5 minutes after the first shot was
fired. Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. When you went back there, did you walk by the front of
the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No; when we went back, we came&mdash;we went back the same way
we came. We went straight across Elm and then up to Houston on the south side
of Elm, and then crossed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice whether or not people were going in or coming out
of the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. There seemed to be a lot of people around&mdash;uh&mdash;the front; but,
of course, there were a lot of people all over the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You got back up to the building&mdash;the records building&mdash;and
then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, as I said, we went up to the fourth floor to our office.
Uh&mdash;I stayed there for 5 or 10 minutes. Bob had left. And then I went next
door in the purchasing department where they've got a radio. I was trying to&mdash;I
didn't&mdash;I don't guess I really believed yet that it had happened&mdash;that the
President had been shot. And&mdash;uh&mdash;I was trying to find out on the radio just
exactly what did happen.</p>

<p>And I stayed in the purchasing department 5 minutes or so&mdash;well, 5 or 10
minutes, and then I went back down the hall where some people had a radio
standing out in the hall. They had another station on, and still nobody knew
anything.</p>

<p>Then, I went back to the office about&mdash;oh, maybe 5 or 10 minutes till 1, and-uh&mdash;we
heard a bunch of sirens, police cars, and leaned out the window, and
police cars were all surrounding the Texas School Book Depository Building.
And when I saw all that and saw the detectives in the window, the officers, I knew
that&mdash;I realized that the shots&mdash;that they must have the assassin in there or the
man who did the shooting&mdash;or something was wrong with the building.</p>

<p>So, I realized then that it possibly was the man I saw since he was the only
one I remember in a window and that it had something to do with the building&mdash;that
it's possible that the man I saw had something to do with it.</p>

<p>About that time a deputy from the sheriff's office came up and asked me if I
was Ronald Fischer, and I said, "Yes;" and he said that Sheriff Decker wanted
to see me in his office right now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time was this now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. This was at&mdash;oh&mdash;1 o'clock on or about 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then went to Sheriff Decker's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I went to Decker's office and&mdash;uh&mdash;Bob Edwards was in there.
He looked up&mdash;and he had given them my name and told them&mdash;at least, this is
what he told me&mdash;that he told them that we had both been standing there
together and had seen this man in the window of the School Book Depository
Building. So, that's why they came to get me&mdash;because he had told them.</p>

<p>There were a lot of other people in the office&mdash;12 or 15 other people. They
all seemed to be connected with it in some way or another. And I noticed, too, in
Sheriff Decker's office was this man and woman and two boys that we had
talked to down the street there on Elm that had hit the ground when the shots
started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, this man that you saw in the window&mdash;did he appear to be
standing or sitting&mdash;or couldn't you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. He must not have been standing because I don't think the floor
was that far away. He could have been standing&mdash;I'll take that back. He
would have had to have been crouched over. He didn't look like he was crouched
over or bent over. He must have been&mdash;I'm guessing&mdash;but I'm thinking he must
have been on his knees or maybe sitting, on a box maybe. But he&mdash;I don't think
that it's possible that he was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he sitting or crouching, or whatever he was doing, in a
straight-up position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No; he was leaning forward slightly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far forward was he leaning&mdash;or couldn't you tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Oh, it was slightly&mdash;enough to where I could tell, but&mdash;oh&mdash;his
head wasn't out of the window and his head wasn't past the window sill. If
he had been much further back in, it would have been hard for me to see him
at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, sometime afterwards, you signed a written statement at
the sheriff's office&mdash;is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And, later, did some policemen bring out a picture of an individual
and ask you to try and identify him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they tell you whose picture it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Whose picture did they say it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, they actually showed me two pictures&mdash;one of Lee Harvey
Oswald, and one of Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. And what did you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I told them that that could have been the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, which one did you say could have been the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Lee Harvey Oswald. That that could have been the man that
I saw in the window of the School Book Depository Building, but that I was
not sure. It's possible that a man fit the general description that I gave&mdash;but
I can't say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything different&mdash;do you remember the picture?&mdash;between
the picture you saw and the man you saw in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes; one thing&mdash;and that is in the picture he looked like he
hadn't shaved in several days at least. And&mdash;uh&mdash;I don't know whether at that
distance, looking at him from the street in the School Book Depository Building&mdash;if
I could have been able to&mdash;if I could have seen that. I think, if he had been
unshaven in the window, it would have made his complexion appear&mdash;well&mdash;rather
dark; but I remember his complexion was light; that is, unless he had
just a light beard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the sun shining on his face when you saw him in the window
or not&mdash;or don't you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No; uh&mdash;no the sun wasn't shining on his face. He was back
in the shadow of the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did the policeman come out with this picture&mdash;on the same
day or on the next day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No; it was&mdash;uh&mdash;no, it was several days after. I can't remember
whether it was a week or 2 weeks or&mdash;it was at least a week. I don't
remember exactly when it was but it was a week, at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this: Was there anything else different between
the man you saw in the picture and the man you saw in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. (Pausing before reply.) No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the color of his hair? Do you remember what the
color of the hair was of the man in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes; it was brown. It was a darker shade of brown but
it was definitely brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean, "a darker shade of brown?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, it wasn't&mdash;it wasn't&mdash;uh&mdash;well, I guess there are a lot
of shades of brown. But it wasn't&mdash;uh&mdash;it wasn't a light brown. It was
a&mdash;in the picture it showed up as definitely a darker brown. I can't think
of anything to compare it to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, when you saw the man in the window, did he appear to
have light brown hair, dark brown, medium brown&mdash;or what kind of hair did
he have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, it wasn't dark and it wasn't light. Uh&mdash;he didn't have
black hair and he didn't have blonde hair. It&mdash;uh&mdash;must have been a brown
but, like I say, there are a lot of different shades of brown and I'm not&mdash;I
can't&mdash;it's hard for me to say just exactly what shade of brown I saw that
he had. I know what shade he had in the picture <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I hand you a copy of a statement which I believe&mdash;at least
has the signature on it&mdash;and ask you to see if this looks like it's your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. [After perusing paper.] Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. I'm going to call this "Fischer Deposition Exhibit
No. 1," and ask you to read this statement, which appears to be dated November
22, 1963, and ask you to state if there's anything in that statement that
does not appear to be accurate.</p>

<p>(Thereupon, the statement of Mr. Fischer dated Nov. 22, 1963, is identified
as "Fischer Deposition Exhibit No. 1.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. You want me to read this now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can just read it to yourself and then you can tell me when
you get through whether or not there is anything in that statement that doesn't
appear to be accurate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. [After reading Exhibit No. 1.] That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this what you told these people there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, in this statement it says that the man appeared to be in
his twenties&mdash;is that what you told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It says that all you could see was his head, now you've told me
here today that you could see his chest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes; from the middle of his chest up. I could see his shoulders.</p>

<p>Uh&mdash;the man taking that particular piece of paper was a court reporter in
the records building, and he didn't&mdash;he didn't relate&mdash;he had about 12 of these
things to take&mdash;well, yeah, 12 or 15&mdash;however many people there were in the
sheriff's office at that time. And he was, like I say, he was in a hurry to get
it down and I said I could see his head&mdash;and, so, he put that down. And that
is right. I could see his head.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The statement here says that he was light-headed and that he
had on an open-neck shirt. Did he have an open-neck shirt on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, what about being light-headed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. By "light-headed," I meant that he didn't have black hair.
He didn't have dark&mdash;he didn't have&mdash;well, when I say "dark," I mean black.
He didn't have black hair. He didn't have blonde hair. When I said, "light-headed,"
I didn't mean blonde&mdash;or I would have said that, but&mdash;uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color of hair did you mean? Did you say "light-headed"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I believe I did say "light-headed"&mdash;because I didn't&mdash;like I
say&mdash;I didn't want it to appear that he was dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By "dark," what color do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Black.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, once again, I'll ask you, to the best of your recollection,
what color hair did he have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Uh&mdash;like I say, it's too hard for me to&mdash;uh&mdash;to tell one way
or the other. At the distance I was, uh&mdash;it's just&mdash;it's just too hard for me
to&mdash;I'm not going to say it because I don't know for sure, just exactly what
shade of hair he did have. It wasn't blonde and it wasn't black. Somewhere
in between. And it was a shade of brown that as to whether it was a dark
brown, a light brown, a medium brown, or whatever you call it&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>The statement says that you saw him in the window there. Do you remember
how far the window was open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. The window was open almost all the way open if not, all the
way open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that "all the way"&mdash;when you have a window all the way
open of that kind, of course, you just have a half of the window case that is
open. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. That's right, You still have half an area of the opening
covered by glass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it the bottom area that was open or the top area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. The bottom area. The window looked to be&mdash;uh&mdash;a window
that raised from the bottom up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And it appeared to be almost as fully open as you could, or
fully open?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Or fully open. Yes&mdash;Or I wouldn't have been able to see the
cases and see past the top of his head had it not been&mdash;and his shoulders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, on this written statement it says that you remember a
tall girl walking into the School Book Depository Building there at about the
time you saw the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see such a girl walk in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I can't remember. It must have been before. It must have
been just before&mdash;uh&mdash;I saw the man in the window. I can't remember very
well. It's been too long. I believe it was before I saw the man in the window
that I saw her walk into the building. Like I say, I made a mental note of
it but I didn't pay too much attention at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, sometime later, after November 22, you were interviewed
by the FBI. Do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes; in the records building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And did the FBI man have any pictures with him at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I don't remember whether he had pictures or not. It seems
like he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you identify the man you saw in the window from any
of the pictures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Uh&mdash;not&mdash;in fact, I believe they asked me&mdash;I believe they
did have pictures of him. It seems like I recall them asking me if it could
have been the picture that they identified as Lee Harvey Oswald, or if it could
have been the picture of Jack Ruby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now what did you say about the Jack Ruby picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I told them that I didn't think it could be him because&mdash;uh&mdash;he
didn't&mdash;he didn't have near enough hair, it didn't look like to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about his build?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. And that, too. His face was just a little&mdash;uh&mdash;fat; whereas-uh&mdash;Oswald's
picture was rather a slender face and neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the man you saw in the window have a high forehead or
a low forehead&mdash;or do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I can't&mdash;I can't remember seeing that&mdash;uh&mdash;that well. I don't
know if I could have&mdash;if I saw it now, whether I could tell you whether he
had a large forehead or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you have any estimate of how far you were from that window
when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Uh&mdash;from the point where I was standing when I saw him in
the window to him, it must have been, I would say, at least a hundred feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, did you ever tell anyone, or might you have
told them, that you saw this person a minute or two before you saw the motorcade,
rather than as you told us here today, 15 or 20 seconds before you first
saw the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever tell anyone it was a minute or two before you saw
the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Well, I might have said "a minute or two" in just terms. I
don't remember saying that but.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But what is <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Shortly before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Shortly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Shortly before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you definitely remember that it was this 15 or 20 seconds or
so before you saw the motorcade, or might it have been a minute or two before
you saw the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I don't think it was over a minute. It could&mdash;it was less than
a minute&mdash;because, as I recall, that's what&mdash;that's the reason I turned my
attention from him and I looked back down the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Is there anything else you can think of that bears on
the assassination, or anything you saw or did or heard that you haven't related
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. (Pausing before reply.) No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you say "No"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. No&mdash;I can't think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Shortly before this interview began, you and I met for the first
time&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And we first chatted a few minutes about what you saw before
we started taking your testimony on the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not I asked you to tell me
your story or whether or not, instead, I asked you questions and tried to, in
any way, lead you&mdash;or so forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. I answered the questions as I think that I saw the events
happen&mdash;as I saw the events happen. I was not quizzed on what to say or
anything of that nature. I've merely related what I think that I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything that you told me of before we started taking the
deposition that has not been included in this deposition&mdash;that you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. [Pausing before reply.] No; not that I can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>I believe that ends the deposition.</p>

<p>I want to thank you for your courtesy in coming here, Mr. Fischer. We appreciate
your taking the time to do it. And we would also appreciate your conveying
our appreciation to the Dallas County Auditor for letting you take this
time off. Will you do that, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Fischer</span>. Yes; and thank you.</p>

<p>The testimony of Robert Edwin Edwards was taken at 11 a.m., on April 9,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you stand and raise your right hand and be sworn, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Robert Edwin Edwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Tahlequah, Okla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you do up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I am going to school, college, Northeastern State College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What year of school are you in? Are you a freshman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No; I am a senior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are a senior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been going up to school there for several years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Two years I went there. I laid out last year and worked here
in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you originally from Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No; Graham, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Graham High School in Graham, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got out of school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I attended Abilene College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For a year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. One year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Decatur Baptist College, which is a junior college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Northeastern State College in Tahlequah, Okla.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Laid out last year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes; I am finishing up this semester.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do last fall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I worked at the courthouse there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that the Dallas County Courthouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Let's say down on Main. I guess that would be sufficient.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What street crosses there, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Well, you mean&mdash;give me a multiple choice and I will tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Harwood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Elm? Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. It runs right behind it, if I am not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you working on the day the President came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That was November 22, 1963, I believe on a Friday, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have lunch before the motorcade came by or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you with anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Ronald Fischer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Ronald Fischer. Did he work with you in that office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes; he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were you doing there? By the way, what was your job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Just a utility clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Came back and worked. I don't know exactly what time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
For a little while until it was time for the President to come by, and then we
left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go? You say you left. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. You mean left the office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Down on&mdash;I get the streets mixed up. Let's see, it would be
Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes; I guess it would be Houston across the street in the little
park right across from the courthouse, straight across from, facing the
Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let me ask you this now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. That is Elm, I guess that is what it is. I guess that is Elm
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you used the word "Depository," what building do you
mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. That building is at the corner of Elm and Houston, isn't it?
Houston comes this way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, Houston, I believe, runs in a north-south direction. Elm
runs in a east-west direction. Would a map help you at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me see if I can get one for you here.</p>

<p>I am handing you a portion of a map. You see Houston Street here on this
map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you see Elm Street running this way, and the arrow pointing
north, so Houston runs north and south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Where do you put the courthouse?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The courthouse would be off this strip of map, but that is Elm
and here is Houston. This little black square would be the Texas School Book
Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. It would have to be Houston and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here is Elm going in the parkway here. Do you see that right
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, Main Street would be running toward the bottom of
the map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes; it was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are putting your finger at the point which would be to the
west of Houston Street and to the south of Elm as it goes into the parkway,
is that right?</p>

<p>You see the arrow pointing northwest would be to your left on the map, and
you are going to be west of Houston Street and south of Elm going in the
parkway, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes; I would be over here, right over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here is the parkway. Can you see it upside down here? Let's see
if I can show you a picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I am sorry. I don't have a picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here is a map and on the map north is shown with an arrow.
You see it right here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Edwards, have you now located yourself on this map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, where were you located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I guess I would plant myself right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are planting yourself now at a spot which would be on the
west side of Houston Street near that entrance of Elm Street into the parkway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
there, and you would be facing in a northerly direction toward the School
Book Depository Building, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who were you standing with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Ronald Fischer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What time did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long before the motorcade came by, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Where is that little paper and I will tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Can you remember without looking at any paper right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No; not really. I can guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your best guess? We will understand that it is just a
guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Maybe I'd better not guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, if you don't care to guess, that is fine. We would prefer
that you not make any statement unless you feel fairly sure about it.</p>

<p>What did you do when you got to this point?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Stood there and waited for the motorcade to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you look around at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Certainly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever take a look at the south side of the Texas School
Book Depository Building? That would be facing&mdash;you would be looking at
the south side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever look at that at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before the motorcade came by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Nothing of importance except maybe one individual who was
up there in the corner room of the sixth floor which was crowded in among
boxes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What portion of the sixth floor as you looked at the building to
your right or to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. To my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How near the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. The corner window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The corner window there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you describe this individual at all? Was he a white man
or a Negro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. White man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Tall or short, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he have anything in his hand at all that you could see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see his hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of clothes did he have on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Light colored shirt, short sleeve and open neck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How much of him could you see? Shoulder up, waist up, knees
up, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. From the waist on. From the abdomen or stomach up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the man fat, thin, or average in size?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Oh, about average. Possibly thin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you tell whether he was light skinned or medium skin or
what, if you could tell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the sun shining in or not, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the sun out that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color hair did the man have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Light brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Light brown hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. That is what I would say; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any other people on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice whether or not there were any, or just did you
look and see any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I notice that there&mdash;I just didn't see any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the next floor above? Did you see any people on
the floor above?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about on any floors below? See any people on the fifth
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Third floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Possibly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Second floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. First floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, you signed an affidavit for the sheriff's department
where you stated that you saw a man at the window on the fifth floor, and
the window was wide open all the way, and there was a stack of books around
him, I could see. And you just told me you didn't see a man on the fifth floor.
Was that affidavit correct or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. That is incorrect. That has been straightened out since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean it has been straightened out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Well, they discussed it with me later and I took that back.
That was the FBI. It was the sixth floor, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How do you know it was the sixth floor? Sixth floor rather
than the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I went with them and I showed them the window, and I
didn't count the bottom floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the first time when you made the affidavit you didn't
count the bottom floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you went out with the FBI, they asked you to point out
the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you pointed out the same window you saw on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you weren't counting the bottom floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. They did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you watch them count?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how many floors from the top it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I think seven in all, seven floors. It is next to the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not the hair of the man was short,
average, or long on the man that you saw in the window that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now what conversation did you and Ronald Fischer have about
this man, if anything? Do you remember what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I made a statement to Ronny that I wondered who he was
hiding from since he was up there crowded in among the boxes, in a joking
manner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean you said it in a joking manner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Fischer say to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I don't recall what he said, but I know that we said a few
things. It wasn't of any importance at the time. And we looked up at him,
both of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you look at him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Just a few seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what took your attention away, if any, or did you just
start looking somewhere else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Started looking somewhere else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long after that did the motorcade come by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Thirty seconds or a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you can remember that you or Ronald Fischer
said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of that might be relevant at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Well, I heard one more then than was fired, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean you said on the affidavit you heard four shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I still right now don't know how many was fired. If I said
four, then I thought I heard four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you said four, you mean the affidavit&mdash;maybe we'd better introduce
it into the record as Edward's Deposition Exhibit A. Where do you
think the shots came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the affidavit you stated that the shots seemed to come from
the building there. Did you really say that or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No; I didn't say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, anything else you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to thank you for coming down here. You have an opportunity,
if you want, to come back and read this deposition and sign it, or else
you can waive the signing and reading of it and it will be sent directly to
Washington by the court reporter. It makes no difference to us. You can
read and sign or can waive reading and signing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. I don't want to make an extra trip.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to waive it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Edwards</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Thank you, sir.</p>

<h2 id="t205"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_JEAN_LOLLIS_HILL" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_JEAN_LOLLIS_HILL">TESTIMONY OF MRS. JEAN LOLLIS HILL</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Jean Lollis Hill was taken at 2:30 p.m., on March 24,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Arlen Specter, assistant counsel of the
President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. May the record show that Mrs. Jean Lollis Hill is present at
this moment in response to a letter request that she appear and give a deposition
to the President's Commission investigating the assassination of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>May I say for the record, Mrs. Hill, that the Commission is investigating all
of the facts relating to the shooting and, and we have asked you to appear
here today to tell us what you know, if anything, relating to the actual assassination,
because we understand you were on the scene or nearby at that time.</p>

<p>May the record further reflect that Mrs. Hill was sent a letter under date
of March 18, 1964. With that preliminary statement, I will ask you, Mrs.
Hill, to stand and raise your right hand, if you will please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give before the President's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Commission in this deposition proceeding will be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Will you be seated, please, Mrs. Hill? And would you state
your full name for the record?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Jean Lollis Hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Mrs. Hill, have you received a letter request?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir; I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Under date of March 18, 1964?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I have it here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, when did you see that letter request?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I guess I got it 2 or 3 days afterward&mdash;March 18&mdash;so I must
have gotten it Monday&mdash;no; I couldn't have gotten it yesterday&mdash;I got it
Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That would have been March 21?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. May the record show that a court reporter is present
and is taking verbatim transcript of the deposition of Mrs. Hill, with the
court reporter, Mrs. Hill, and myself being present, and that all of the report is
being transcribed and has been transcribed from the time Mrs. Hill arrived, is
that correct, Mrs. Hill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were you on the day of November 22, 1963, at about
noontime?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I was standing directly across from the Texas School Depository
Building on a grassy slope and the triangle toward the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And that would have been Dealey Plaza?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. If that's what the name of it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would that be on <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It was to the left of the motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To the left of the motorcade as the motorcade proceeded
forward?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, you would have been on the south side of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, what had you done immediately before noontime, Mrs.
Hill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. We had been there for about an hour and a half and had been
walking up and down and back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When you say "we" whom do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. My friend, Mary Moorman, that took the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. She had a camera with her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; a Polaroid. We had been taking pictures all morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you have a camera with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And tell me what you observed as the President's motorcade
passed by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. You <span class="locked">mean&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Start any place that you find most convenient and just tell me
in your own way what happened.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, as they came toward us, we had been taking pictures with
this Polaroid camera and since it was a Polaroid we knew we had only one
chance to get a picture, and at the time she had taken a picture just a few
minutes before and I had grabbed it out of the camera and wrapped it and put
it in my pocket. Just about that time he drew even with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when you say "he" you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The President's car. We were standing on the curb and I jumped
to the edge of the street and yelled, "Hey, we want to take your picture," to
him and he was looking down in the seat&mdash;he and Mrs. Kennedy and their heads
were turned toward the middle of the car looking down at something in the
seat, which later turned out to be the roses, and I was so afraid he was going
to look the other way because there were a lot of people across the street and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
we were, as far as I know, we were the only people down there in that area,
and just as I yelled, "Hey," to him, he started to bring his head up to look at
me and just as he did the shot rang out. Mary took the picture and fell on the
ground and of course there were more shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many shots were there altogether?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I have always said there were some four to six shots. There were
three shots&mdash;one right after the other, and a distinct pause, or just a moment's
pause, and then I heard more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How long a time elapsed from the first to the third of what you
described as the first three shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They were rapidly&mdash;they were rather rapidly fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you give me an estimate on the timespan on those three
shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I don't think I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, how many shots followed what you described as the first
three shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think there were at least four or five shots and perhaps six, but
I know there were more than three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, much time elapsed from the very first shot until the very
last shot, will you estimate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I don't think I could, properly, but my girl friend fell on the
ground after about&mdash;during the shooting&mdash;right, I would say, just immediately
after she had taken the picture&mdash;probably about the third shot. She fell on
the ground and grabbed my slacks and said, "Get down, they're shooting." And,
I knew they were but I was too stunned to move, so I didn't get down. I just
stood there and gawked around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can't you give me any better idea on the sequence of the shots
other than to say that there were three shots right in a row and then a moment's
pause and an additional shot or shots.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. In what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any way you could be more specific by way of time
lapses among any of the shots, from the first to the second shot, the second to
the third, or in that manner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The three were fired as though one person were firing; I mean, to
me. They were fired just like you could reload and fire again or whatever you
do with a gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With what sort of an action?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think that the firing that was done could have been done with
the type gun that they say the assassinator used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what type gun was that, according to your understanding?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. A bolt action.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about the shots that followed the three shots, then,
what would the sequence of timing have been on those?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I thought they were different&mdash;I thought the sequence was
different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How will you describe the sequence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Quicker&mdash;more automatic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were there as few as four, as you recollected?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I won't say positively, I think I can still seemingly hear it, and
I would still say there were more, you know, I'm saying 4 to 6. I know there
were at least 4, and I just almost swear that I heard 5 or 6.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could there have been more than 6 that you heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I couldn't say that I heard more than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you say for certain that you did not hear more than
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I didn't hear any more than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was the position of the President, as best you recollect
it, at the time the first shot was heard by you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was slightly turned, he was sitting back in the seat, like
turned toward Mrs. Kennedy and his head was down, and his hands were like
this (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. His hands were in his lap?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No&mdash;not really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How would you describe the position of his hands?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was sitting here [indicating] and Mrs. Kennedy&mdash;he was like
this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You are indicating the right hand on the left knee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. With the body turned slightly toward the person on his left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who would have been Mrs. Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And were you watching him at this time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, I was looking right at his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what reaction, if any, did he have at the time of the first
shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As I said, I had yelled at him and he had started to raise his
head up and I saw his head start to come up and all at once a bullet rang out
and he slumped forward like this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Lurched or slumped, as you say, to the left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did his head drop down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; he was just, you know, slumping down like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have a chance to see anything of Governor Connally
at that exact second?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There was a scrambling around in the front seat. I didn't know
who was riding with him, I hadn't paid any attention to who was riding with
him in the car, but I never did see Mrs. Connally. I guess my story is probably
colored by what I have heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell me what you have heard that you think maybe that colored
your story?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. About what the Connallys say about the shots, which shots hit
where and everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What is that that you have heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I have heard that 1 shot hit Kennedy and also hit Connally,
that the same shot that hit Kennedy hit Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did you hear that, Mrs. Hill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else have you heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. And also that Mrs. Connally jumped up and covered Mr. Connally
with her body and pushed him to the floor, but I never did see Mrs. Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever see Governor Connally?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I did see him; I didn't know who he was, but I did see him
and I knew that someone had been hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was he pushed in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I just vaguely know that he was toward the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, was he in the front seat of the ear or was he between
President Kennedy and the front seat of the car, or where was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Between President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You know that there were jump seats in the car so that there
would have been people sitting three positions forward, one in the back seat&mdash;President
Kennedy and Mrs. Kennedy, on the right in the jump seat&mdash;Governor
Connally and Mrs. Connally and in the front seat, two Secret Service agents&mdash;people
sitting three positions forward?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I saw the Secret Service agents.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you been, prior to the time I told you just now, familiar
with that arrangement of the personnel in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I knew that, and as I said, I didn't know who the people
were in the car because I am new here&mdash;I don't know the Connallys, I just
knew that people were in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice the person sitting in the jump seat on the right-hand
side, that would be the person immediately in front of President Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I would say it was Mr. Connally.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe him at any specific time?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I saw a man fall to the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And when, in point of time, did you see him fall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. After the President was shot, but I wouldn't&mdash;it wasn't with the
first shot. To me he wasn't hit when the first shot hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is the basis for your saying that, Mrs. Hill?</p>

<p>Mrs.. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I just think that he was hit after Kennedy was hit because,
well, just the way that it looked, I would say that he was hit later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, do you associate the time that Governor Connally appeared
to have been hit with any specific shot that you heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The second.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what specifically did you observe at the time of the second
shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, that's what I thought had happened&mdash;that they had hit
someone in the front part of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you observe at the time of the third shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. President Kennedy was hit again and he had further buffeted his
body and I didn't realize at the time what it was&mdash;I remarked to my friends in
the police station that day&mdash;did she notice his hair standing up, because it
did. It just rippled up like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And at what time was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. On the third shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you notice Governor Connally at the time of the third
shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I never saw him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What occurred at the time of the fourth shot which you believe
you heard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, at that time, of course, there was a pause and I took the
other shots&mdash;about that time Mary grabbed me and was yelling and I had
looked away from what was going on here and I thought, because I guess from
the TV and movies, that it was Secret Service agents shooting back. To me,
if somebody shoots at somebody they always shoot back and so I just thought
that that's what it was and I thought, well, they are getting him and shooting
back, you know; I didn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was the President's car at the time you thought you
heard the fourth shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The motorcade came to almost a halt at the time the shots rang
out, and I would say it was just approximately, if not&mdash;it couldn't have been
in the same position, I'm sure it wasn't, but just a very, very short distance
from where it had been. It was just almost stunned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how about the time of the fifth shot, where do you think
the President's car was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That was during those shots, I think it wasn't any further than
a few feet&mdash;further down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Which shots, now&mdash;you mean the fourth, and perhaps the fifth
and perhaps the sixth shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Are you able to say what anyone was doing or what events
were occurring at the time of the fourth through perhaps the sixth shots which
you have testified about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, as I said, at that time she was yelling at me and on the
ground.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was yelling at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Mary, my friend, was yelling at me and she was down on the
ground and I looked up and I could see everyone was just stunned, there was
immobility all around and I just stood there looking around and I'm sure there
wasn't a pause&mdash;it seemed like an eternity but I'm sure there was just a slight
pause before things started moving again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were the shots over by that time when things started moving
again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then what happened on the scene?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, they say Mrs. Kennedy climbed up on the back of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you observe that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I have seen pictures that show that she must have, but I
ran across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. To <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Other side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. North side of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right. I saw a man up there running, or getting away
or walking away or something&mdash;I would say he was running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was that man when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was right up there by the School Depository, just&mdash;not at
the corner where they say the shots came from, at the other end, right up on
the slope at the top of the slope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would that be in front of the School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. At the west end?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. More to the west end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would it be between the westernmost point of the building and
some other point in the building? Was he at the westernmost point or farther
east than the westernmost point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I would say he was farther east than the westernmost point.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you draw a diagram for me in rough outline, starting
with Houston <span class="locked">Street&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; but I can't do this very well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Permit me to draw an outline, then, to get your bearing here
and realizing that I want your recollection, and I'll ask you the questions.
Assume that Houston Street is the street which I am marking Houston. Assume
that this is Main Street. Assume that Elm Street curves down in the
manner that I am drawing and marking.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Assume that the Texas School Book Depository is this large
building which I will mark "TSBD." Now, would you place with the letter
"A" where you were at the time the President went by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I would have to place the President first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine&mdash;place him with the letter "X".</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All right&mdash;if he were <span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, was he in the center of the street or on the side of the
street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was on the side&mdash;he wasn't just completely over there, but
he was past the center of the street and we <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, place yourself with the letter "A".</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Right there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Make it a big printed "A" for us.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Okay. [Complied with request of counsel Specter.]</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, would you place the position you ran to after the President's
car went by?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. By that time, I'm sure the car was here&mdash;it was on down a little
way, and I ran behind here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Draw a line to where you ran.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All right&mdash;I don't know whether I've got this just right&mdash;but I ran
approximately right up through here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Put a "B" here where you were when you came to a stop
on the other side of the street.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. These steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, where were you when you first noticed <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. These steps that go up&mdash;I guess you've looked at the site, there
are some steps down there that go up to that promenade, or whatever you
call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That go in a generally westerly direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Beyond the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; and I was just on this <span class="locked">side&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. "This side"&mdash;you are meaning&mdash;the east of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The east of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you beyond the westernmost point of the Texas School
Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were still in front of that building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is the letter "B" now in the position where you were
when you first saw that man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where was that man, indicating with the letter "C," where
he was? He was very close to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, he was at the top of this hill&mdash;you don't leave me any space
in here&mdash;I mean, there's a distance in here greater than what is shown here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He was between Elm Street and the Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where did you see him going?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I saw him go toward the tracks, toward the railroad tracks to
the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you observe about that man, if anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That he just had on a brown overcoat and a hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why was your attention attracted to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Because he was the only thing moving up there. The other people
were all grief stricken and standing there and I don't know what I would have
done with him when I got up there, but I don't know why I even had the
instinct to run, and I don't know that it is anything even connected with this,
but since I had already&mdash;I have told it and it is part of my recollection, I am
just stating it again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, was there anything about the man that attracted your
attention to him beside the fact that he was moving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I just thought at the time&mdash;that's the man that did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you think that this was the man that did it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I just don't know&mdash;I mean&mdash;that was my thought.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see any weapon in his hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I never saw a weapon during the whole time, in anyone's
hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see that man from the front?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As well as I remember, now, when I saw him he was turning
and going to the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he in the process of turning when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I would say he was turning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So that you had some view of his front part of his body?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you see any weapon at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, sir; he was three-fourths turned by the time I did see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you see both of his hands at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Could you see one of his hands at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I do not even remember seeing his hands.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I mean, if he was turning, his hands would have been visible,
wouldn't they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They surely would have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, what you are saying is, you don't have any recollection of
seeing his hands?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I have no recollection&mdash;that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But from the position of his body, his hands would have been
in the position where they could have been observed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right&mdash;surely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And do you have any recollection of observing any weapon
in either hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I never saw a weapon the whole time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Had you moved from point "A" at the time you first saw him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's the reason I ran across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see him while you were at point "A"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Do you mean prior to the shots? Yes; I saw him, that's the reason
why I went across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, you saw him when you were at point "A"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right&mdash;that's the reason I left that spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And he was at point "C" when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he move before you moved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. His moving made me start after him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. So, he did move before you moved?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; and as I came across the street&mdash;as I said&mdash;I never did see
Mrs. Kennedy get up or anything, because when I ran across the street, the
first motorcycle that was right behind her nearly hit me turning around, because
I looked up in his face and he was looking all around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mean the policeman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; and I don't think he ever did see me. I just looked at him
and dodged then because I thought his wheel was going to hit me, and I don't
think he ever did see me, and I ran across through there and started up the
hill. When I looked down on the ground, I mean, as I was running up the hill
to catch that man, I looked down and saw some red stuff and I thought, "Oh,
they got him, he's bleeding," and this is embarrassing, but it turned out to be
Koolade or some sort of red drink.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You thought they had gotten the man who was running away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You thought that perhaps the second burst of shots you heard
were being directed toward him by the Secret Service?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I just thought, "Oh, goodness, the Secret Service is shooting back."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe what that man looked like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He <span class="locked">wasn't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How tall was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He wasn't very tall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he more than 5 feet tall, or can you give me any meaningful
description of him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, yes; but I don't want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, because I had told several people and I also said it that
day down there and the person that I described, and I am fully aware that
his whereabouts have been known at all times, and that it seems that I am
merely using a figure and converting it to my story, but the person that I saw
looked a lot like&mdash;I would say the general build as I would think Jack Ruby
would from that position. But I have talked with the FBI about this and I
told them I realized that his whereabouts had been covered at all times and
of course I didn't&mdash;at that time I didn't realize that the shots were coming
from the building. I frankly thought they were coming from the knoll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you think they were coming from the knoll?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That was just my idea where they were coming from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Would you draw the knoll on the picture, where you mean by
the knoll?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This area in front of the Book Depository&mdash;it's right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Just draw me a circle as to where you had a general impression
the shots were coming from.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is a hill and it was like they were coming from right in
there. That's when I looked up and saw that man and all the rest of the
people were stunned and not moving in that area and yet he was getting out of
there&mdash;I thought that probably he had done it, and so I went to catch him, for
some reason.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you have a conscious impression of the source of
the first shot that you heard, that is, where it came from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, evidently I didn't because the only conscious recollection
I have of that&mdash;I mean&mdash;until all this other came out&mdash;I had always thought
that they came from the knoll.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you have any conscious impression of where the second
shot came from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any conscious impression of where this third shot came from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Not any different from any of them. I thought it was just people
shooting from the knoll&mdash;I did think there was more than one person shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You did think there was more than one person shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What made you think that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The way the gun report sounded and the difference in the way
they were fired&mdash;the timing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What was your impression as to the source of the second group
of shots which you have described as the fourth, perhaps the fifth, and perhaps
the sixth shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, nothing, except that I thought that they were fired by
someone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you have any idea where they were coming from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; as I said, I thought they were coming from the general direction
of that knoll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, did you think that the Secret Service was firing them from
that knoll?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I said I didn't know&mdash;I really don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You just had the general impression that shots were coming
from the knoll?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you had the general impression that the Secret Service was
firing the second group of shots at the man who fired the first group of shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you had no specific impression as to the source of those
shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you get a very good look at that man, who you say was
starting to run?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, as I said, when I looked down at this red stuff on the ground,
I said, "Oh," you know, to myself, "they hit him." You know, I was going to
follow that, and when I looked up again, I looked all around and I couldn't
see him anywhere and I kept running toward the train tracks and I looked
all around out there and I couldn't see him&mdash;I looked everywhere and I heard
someone yelling something about&mdash;it was just this voice that was yelling, "It
looks like he got away," or something&mdash;I thought I had been right, you know,
that he had really gone up there and he had gotten away some way in the tracks
or had gone around behind the Depository, and so, I didn't know where he had
gone. By that time I saw policemen&mdash;where he had gone. By that time I saw
policemen&mdash;some were coming off of their motorcycles just around the curb
here&mdash;just at the underpass here, and of course, the motorcade sped away and
the policemen were coming from all sorts of different directions, people were
closing in, and all I could think of was, "I want to get out of here fast. I don't
want to be caught by anybody. I don't want to be in on anything," and everytime
anybody would come toward me I would go another way until I got off of
that hill back up there where the tracks were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you run up toward the hill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I ran up toward the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Let me draw the triple underpass there, and you ran up to what
point&mdash;where? About the point of "D" here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Why did you run up there&mdash;after the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I was still looking for him. I didn't know where he had gone.
I heard lots of people yelling, "Did he get away, did he get away, and which way
did he go."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were trying to catch him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you couldn't find him any more?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I just couldn't find him again. When I stopped to look down
at the grass, at this red stuff and when I looked back up, by that time everyone
was screaming and moving around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And where were you when you looked down at the ground?
Point it out to me on the diagram.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The steps that go up to this colonnade thing right there and I saw
it right about here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, mark it with the letter "E" there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, a moment ago you said you didn't want to say anything
more about the identity of the man. Why did you tell me that, Mrs. Hill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, because I have had an awful lot of fun made of me over
being a witness in this and I'm real tired of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who made fun of you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, quite a lot of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Anybody connected with the official investigation in the case?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, oh, no; it was just people, but people that I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, and why have they made fun of you, because of your
identification of who that man was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Any other reason?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes&mdash;I saw a dog in the car. They kept asking me, and I even
gave that out on a radio or TV interview that I had seen a dog in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In which car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Between the President and Mrs. Kennedy, and they kept asking
me what kind of a dog and I said, "I don't know, I wasn't interested in what
was in the seat," but I said, "It was white and fuzzy," and I said, "It was
something white and kind of fuzzy and it was in the seat between them," and
I said, "I just got to thinking&mdash;it must be a small dog," because I had remarked
to my girl friend as they were taking us in the police station, I said, "Why?"
I said, "I could see Liz Taylor or the Gabors traveling with a bunch of dogs,
but I can't see the Kennedys traveling with dogs. Why would they have a dog
with them on tour?" And, when we remarked about that she and I both&mdash;and
I said, "Did you see it? What kind of a dog was it? Why were they taking
a dog?" I found out later that it was those roses in the seat, but I knew they
were looking at something and I just barely glanced and I saw this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there any other reason people made fun of you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, basically, the people that made fun of me was my husband,
and, of course, that was because&mdash;does this have to go in the record?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Yes; only in the sense that we are putting everything on the
record. This really isn't too important but it is the best procedure to follow,
that everything be written down.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. In a situation of this sort.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, because I talked with an Oklahoma twang, and called Mrs.
Kennedy "Jackie" and I said, "He pitched forward in Jackie's lap," and I just
didn't rehearse it and do it right at all, because I didn't know it was going to be
taken down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And those are the reasons your husband made fun of you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; and because I saw a dog and he was thoroughly hilarious
when he found out that it was roses in the back seat and that I had seen a dog,
and he said, "Of all people in the United States you would have to see a dog."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Has anybody made fun of you besides your husband?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; not really, but he's done enough for a whole bunch of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, going back to the question of the description of this man,
can you describe him in any more detail than you already have?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I haven't&mdash;I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. His height you said was about the height of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about his weight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's the only thing&mdash;I would say&mdash;he certainly wasn't any bigger
than Jack Ruby.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he smaller than Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He could have been smaller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How about&mdash;was he wearing a hat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I said he was wearing a hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he wearing a top coat?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; an overcoat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And was he wearing a tie, could you tell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I didn't notice. It was a brown, I mean, I just got the impression
of a brown hat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you give me an estimate of his age?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I would say the man was middle aged, or say, I would say 40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was he a white man or a Negro?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He was a white man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Can you describe him in any other way to me?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think he was, in fact, Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you told me all that you can recollect about this man
and your reason for moving toward him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you were at point "D," what did you do after being at
point "D," which we have marked on the diagram?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, as I said, the policemen were coming by that time from
different areas, coming and closing this place off, and I was dodging them,
trying to get back across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Back across Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And did you in fact dodge them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And get back across Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what, if anything, did you do next?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. There was a man holding Mary's arm and she was crying and he
had hold of her camera trying to take it with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Featherstone of the Times Herald, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Dallas Times Herald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right. I ran up there and told him we had to leave. She
had been impressing upon me for an hour and a half&mdash;we hadn't even gone down
to see the President that day&mdash;we had been doing other things and we got
down there and we just decided we would stay, but she had been impressing
upon me for an hour and a half, the whole time we had been there, that we had
to beat the traffic out of there, and she knows her way around real well, so I
knew she could get out and we could beat the traffic, and we were just going to
run for the car as fast as we could. It was parked up here on Houston. We
were going to run and get out of there before the people started milling around
so we wouldn't be in that traffic, and I don't know&mdash;we had been talking about it
so long and she had drilled me so much, that we must get out of here, and when
I came back and I found her crying and him standing there holding her camera,
and holding her, I mean holding her by the arm and her camera, and telling
her she had to go with him, I started trying to shake his hand loose and grab the
camera and telling him that "No, we wouldn't go, we had to leave," and I guess
by that time I was beginning&mdash;until then I have no conscious feeling of any
scaredness or excitement or anything. I mean, you know, it is just like something
that's passing in front of you, and I mean, I wasn't worried or upset in
any way until I got back there and then I had a sense of urgency. I just knew
I wanted to get out of there and all I could think of&mdash;and I don't think the full
impact of all that had happened really hit me then, because I was just wanting
to get out of there and to get away and he kept telling me&mdash;he insisted we go
with him and he just practically ran us, and he got&mdash;they were throwing up a
police net around that building at the time, and he just practically ran us up
to the court house, I guess it is, and put us in this little room and I don't know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
why we were so dumb that day unless it was just the sequence of events, that
everything was just happening so fast we really didn't even think, but we
couldn't leave. He kept standing in front of the door and he would let a cameraman
in or someone to interview us and they were shooting things in our faces,
and he wouldn't let us out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who was interviewing you&mdash;newspaper reporters?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Newspaper reporters and radio and TV people and a man from&mdash;a
man named Coker John, or John Coker.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. From where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As I get it, he is a sort of freelance writer, and I think he was
on an assignment then. He came out&mdash;I'm not sure&mdash;I thought it was for
Life or Post, but he came in there and he was shooting pictures for&mdash;I think he
was shooting them for TV, but he came out to the house about 2 weeks later
with this bunch of men, about four of them, three or four came out, and that's
the second time I saw him, because he said, "You remember me, I saw you in
the pressroom that day."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is that Miss Hill or Mrs. Hill?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It is Mrs. Hill, and he said "I saw you in the pressroom that
day," and I said, "Yes." I remembered him because I saw him more than any&mdash;now,
I don't remember where I am here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You were telling me about what happened to you at the county
courthouse, and then you digressed from that to tell me about John coming to
see you in your home.</p>

<p>Let's go back to the county courthouse and let me ask you if you gave an
affidavit to the sheriff that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did you talk to anybody from the Federal Government that
day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Whom did you talk to?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What agency was the man from, if you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many times have you talked to somebody from the Secret
Service in this case altogether?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I would say the only time I talked to the Secret Service men was
when I was down at the courthouse that afternoon, just before they let us
leave, and I think&mdash;now, we officially sat down and supposedly were giving a
story to the Secret Service men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And, did they write down what you were telling them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I don't think they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you sign anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Oh, well, I signed my statement that I made over in the sheriff's
office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Then, how about for the Secret Service men, did you sign
anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No, I don't think we signed anything over there, because they
just took us in a little <span class="locked">room&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you tell the Secret Service men?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As well as I remember, we talked to so many that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, did you tell everybody about the same thing you have
told me here today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes, except that I didn't go into that stuff with the shots because
no one ever asked me, no one ever detailed it like that, but they were interested
that day in those pictures and they got them all from us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk with the Secret Service men on any occasion after
the events on November 22?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you ever talked to anybody else from the Federal Government?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. The FBI men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On how many occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Several.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. How many, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I don't recall&mdash;I was called two or three times at least after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Called on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You discussed the matter over the phone with somebody who
said he was from the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I had that pulled on me and I didn't want to talk until I
called back down to check to see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you talk to somebody from the FBI when you called them
back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Over the phone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On how many occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think two or three times is all I had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Were you ever interviewed in person by the FBI?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On how many occasions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. After that day, I believe only once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And about when was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, it was the other day after I received this letter&mdash;no; before
I received this letter, and this was last Tuesday, I think, and they came in
reference to what Mark Lane had told the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did they ask you when they came to see you last
Tuesday, that would be a week ago today or the 16th&mdash;or the 17th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They just had me start over with this story again and they had
Mr. Lane's copy and they asked me, you know, if I had said these things and, I
read it and told them that I had said it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was Mr. Lane's version accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It was accurate in that he took down what I said. It was inaccurate
in that he had taken it out of context, and the questions he asked
me weren't there, nor were they given. I can see how he could have made what
he made out of my statements.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. When did you talk to Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I talked to him about&mdash;approximately 4 or 6 weeks ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where did that take place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. At New York.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he call you on the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right, and he didn't tell me he was recording this at the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever talk to Mark Lane in person?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you ever sign an affidavit for him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. The only contact you had with him was this one telephone
conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right, and he said he was coming to Dallas the next week
and would I talk with him, I said, I told him then&mdash;that I guessed so. I didn't
know. I mean, because I didn't fully realize what he was doing in this case.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what did you tell him over the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I told him the same story I told you, with the exception that
he went further into the day's activities at the police station, and at the
courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else did you tell him about your day's activities at the
courthouse?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, he asked me, you know, he just asked me a lot of questions
about that, and I told him that we didn't know that we were in a pressroom.
We just knew we were in a courthouse and with police. I mean, this was
to us a police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Tell me all the things that you told him, in addition to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
which you have already told me, that is, tell me all the things you told Mr.
Lane, in addition to that you have already testified about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I will, but do you realize I have had to go over this so many
times that I don't know who I have told which part to? I really don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, I'll bear that in mind, but do the best you can in telling
me all the things you told Mark Lane.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Can't you just read my statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Feel free to smoke&mdash;just relax.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I would except, I don't have one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Just relax if you can.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. All right, if I can.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>Let the record show that we were taking a brief recess to get the witness
a cup of coffee so that she may be more relaxed. May the record show that
we have just obtained some coffee and we are proceeding.</p>

<p>When we broke for the coffee, I had asked you to tell me all the things you
told Mark Lane other than those which you have already testified about.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Before we go into that&mdash;I do want to have you&mdash;because I hope
that by this time I am through with it, but I do want to tell you about a camera
team that came out there to my house that this John Coker was with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. On which occasion was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That is important to me and that is the reason why I digressed
and got on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. This occurred, you say, about 2 weeks after the assassination?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Say&mdash;10 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What happened on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They came out and brought TV cameras and were going to take,
and they told me they were not going to tell me the questions that they were
going to ask me, that they wanted to get my reactions to their questions, and
they set up rather, I would say they set up hypothetical situations like&mdash;could
he have been shot from the window, if this is the kind of wound that it would
have made? Or, to make this kind of a wound, he had to have been here, now
which, you know&mdash;and so I told them and from what I gathered that day, they
did not think I had&mdash;I had gotten the idea from them, that there was speculation
or some reasonable doubt that I&mdash;that Oswald did not do all the shooting
and that all these shots did not come from the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You told the newspaper and the television cameramen that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's what I got from them from the questions they asked me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What answers did you give them to those questions?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, when they would set up a situation, I would tell them what
I thought would have had to happen in that situation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, without formulating any questions which would lead you
in any way to any conclusions, let me ask you for your best recollection as to
what you think occurred, as to the point where the assassin was, if you have
any idea on that question?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, as I said previously, to me at the time the shot came from
the knoll, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And you have testified to that because of the sound of the shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And also because you saw this man running away.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you think perhaps that you had the impression that that
came from the knoll exclusively because you saw the man running away? And
your reaction that that must have been the man who did the shooting?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. It could have been very well&mdash;it could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, are there any other factors which led you to think that
the shots came from the knoll, factors other than those you have already told
me about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Except that I believe these men thought so that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, never mind the men, but focus just on what your reaction
was at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's what I thought. At the time I thought that there was
more than one person shooting, as I said before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, you have already told me about that and you told me about
the source of the knoll, and you told me why you thought that was more than
one person, and now, what I'm trying to get at is why you thought they came
from the knoll&mdash;was it first because the way the shot sounded and secondly, because
the man ran away, and then I asked you the second question&mdash;did you
think perhaps they came from the knoll exclusively because you saw the man
run away, and you said you thought that might be the case.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Could be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And then I asked you were there any other findings other than
those we have already talked about, which would make you think that the
shots came from the knoll, based on your own personal observations, recollections
or impressions.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Nothing that comes to mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is there anything else about that television interview which
you consider important?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Except for the fact it left me very doubtful and confused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Because they gave you a lot of hypothetical situations, and you
didn't know which was which, if you listened to them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right&mdash;they had some very strange ideas which I have
heard here and there voiced by other people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were they doing basically, asking you to comment on those
various theories?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I asked why were they coming out here, why would they come
to my home, why was that important, and they said, "Something big is going
to break in a little while and we want to put it on first. We want to be ready
for it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did they ever put that television interview on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I have never seen any, but then, I never saw myself on TV either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Is there anything else about that television interview which you
now consider important?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I know that it has bothered me ever since it happened, and
particularly since I have been questioned these other times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. By the FBI last week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; and without things of comments, and speculation that I have
heard, and remarks that I've gone back over, of happenings that have happened
to me that day and as to the way it happened, and frankly, I would either like
to say it again or <span class="locked">something&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Like to say what again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I would like to see this telecast or hear that questioning again
because there's something about it that keeps in the back of my <span class="locked">mind&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you can't put your finger on what it is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. But you are annoyed or bothered or perplexed with it or confused
by that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; I have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you told me everything that you have to say about
that television interview?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, moving on to the question about Mark Lane, what did
you tell him other than that which you have told me here today?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He asked me where we were taken and I told him in the pressroom,
that we didn't know it was the pressroom at the time, and that we didn't
know we couldn't leave and because they kept standing across the door, and the
first time we really&mdash;we were getting tired of it, I mean, we had been down
there quite a while and we were getting tired of it and we wanted to leave
and this is what I told him, and so some man came in and offered Mary a sum,
I think&mdash;say&mdash;$10,000 or something like this for this picture.</p>

<p>We realized that&mdash;they said, "Don't sell the picture." He was a representative
of either Post or Life, and they said, "Don't sell that picture until our
representatives have contacted you or a lawyer or something." Anyway, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
realized at that time we didn't have that picture, that it had been taken from us.
I mean, we had let Featherstone look at it, you know, but we told no one they
could reproduce it. They said, "Would you let us look at it and see if it could
be reproduced?" We said, "Yes; you could look at it," we thought it was&mdash;you
know, it was fuzzy and everything, but we were wanting to keep them and we
suddenly realized we didn't have that picture, and that was quite a bit of
money and we were getting pretty excited about it, and Mary was getting
<span class="locked">scared&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did she eventually sell the picture, by the way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. She sold the rights, the publishing rights of it, not the original
picture, but they had already&mdash;AP and UP had already picked it up because
Featherstone stole it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know what she sold those rights for?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I think it was $600.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What did you tell Mark Lane besides about the picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Fine, go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Anyway, when I realized we didn't have that picture and Mary
was getting upset about that&mdash;by that time I had realized we were in a pressroom
and that he had no right to be holding us and he had no authority and
that we could get out of there, and they kept standing in front of the door, and
I told him&mdash;I said, "Get out." We kept asking him for our picture, and where
it was, and he said, "We'll get it back&mdash;we'll get it back. And so I jerked away
and ran out of the door and as I did, there was a Secret Service man. Now, this
I was told&mdash;that he was a Secret Service man, and he said, "Do you have a red
raincoat?" And, I said, "Yes; it's in yonder. Let me go." I was intent on
finding someone to get that picture back and I said as I walked out, "I can get
someone big enough to get it back for us." He said, "Does your friend have a
blue raincoat?" And I said, "Yes; she's in there." He said, "Here they are," to
somebody else and they told us that they had been looking for us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who told you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. This man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All this you told Mr. Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. And so, then they took us into the police station. Just about that
time Sheriff Decker came out and the man was with us and we were telling
him why we were in there, why we had been in the pressroom, you know, and
why they hadn't been able to find us, because they had thought that Mary had
been hit and they were looking for the two women that were standing right by
the car with the camera. At that time they didn't know what we were doing
down there and why we were right at the car. So, there followed questioning
all afternoon long, and he asked me at one time&mdash;well, in fact he asked repeatedly
if I was held and I told him, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who asked you that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Mark Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. If you were held?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; you know if I were held, if I had to stay there and I told
him, "Yes," but I told him when we were in the pressroom it was just our own
ignorance, really, that was keeping us there and letting the man intimidate us
that had no authority.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. That was a newsman as opposed to the police official?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; and I gave Mark Lane his name several times&mdash;clearly. I
remember clearly that I gave him his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what name did you give him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Featherstone of the Times Herald, and so after we got out of there
and I talked with a <span class="locked">man&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, you are continuing to tell me everything you told Mark
Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right, and I talked with this man, a Secret Service man,
and I said, "Am I a kook or what's wrong with me?" I said, "They keep saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
three shots&mdash;three shots," and I said, "I know I heard more. I heard from four
to six shots anyway."</p>

<p>He said, "Mrs. Hill, we were standing at the window and we heard more
shots also, but we have three wounds and we have three bullets, three shots
is all that we are willing to say right now."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, did that Secret Service man try to suggest to you that
there were only three shots in any other way than that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's all he said to me. He didn't say, "You have to say three
shots"&mdash;he didn't tell me what to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. He didn't try to intimidate you or coerce you in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; that's all he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Go ahead and tell me what you told Mark Lane.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I told him&mdash;I was asked by <span class="locked">them&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know who that Secret Service man was, by the way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; I don't. I don't know&mdash;not any name that day except Decker
and the President.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right, go ahead and tell me everything else you said.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Then, he asked me&mdash;I was asked did I know that a bullet struck
at my feet and I said, "No; I didn't." And he said, "What do you think that
dust was?" And I said, "I didn't see any dust." And I told Mark Lane that
the Times Herald did run a picture in the paper of a concrete scar where
a bullet had hit right where we were standing, which is evident to anybody
that had an issue of the Times Herald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did you see that concrete?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I didn't go back down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Do you know whether or not a bullet did hit that concrete?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. As I say, I saw the picture in the newspaper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Aside from seeing it in the newspaper, do you know anything
about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; other than what the man said he saw out of the window of
the courthouse, the Secret Service man said and it struck at my feet, other
than that&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else did you tell Mark Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. So, he asked me, "Did you have to stay down there or did you
stay of your own accord?" And I said, "No; we had stay there." He said
something&mdash;he said, "Were you threatened or something?" And I told him I
wasn't threatened, but&mdash;he said, "How do you know you were held?" Or something
like that, and I said, "Because I tried to leave twice. At one time I saw
people I knew on the street and I was going to go down and talk to them and I
went down and they came down and got me, and another time I went down
when the evening edition of the paper hit the street and two men," and I told
him, I did not tell him they were Secret Service men, but they were men from
the sheriff's office. There were some kind of deputy or something that came
down and took me back and they were not playing. They meant to take me
back. They did take my arms and I knew I was going, because I just kept
standing on the corner saying, "No; I don't want to go back yet. Please let me
stay down here just a little while." They did make us go back in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Where were they from?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. They were from the sheriff's office, they were just deputies&mdash;they
weren't FBI or Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Was it after that that you gave the affidavit to the sheriff?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What else did you tell Mark Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I told him that my story had already been given, that they
had an affidavit down there, and he said, "Were you ever at any time&mdash;" I
think he said, "Were you ever at any time told not to say something or this,
that, and the other," and I said, "The only thing that I was told not to say
was to not mention the man running," and he said, "And why?" And I said,
"Well, it was an FBI or Secret Service that told me not to, but they came
in to me just right after I was taken&mdash;I was in there in the pressroom, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
told me in fact&mdash;I told him it was Featherstone that told me. He said, "You
know you were wrong about seeing a man running." He said, "You didn't."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who told you you were wrong&mdash;Featherstone or Lane?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Featherstone. And I told him that&mdash;I told Mr. Lane that Mr.
Featherstone had told me that, and I said, "But I did," and he said, "No; don't
say that any more on the air."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Who said, "Don't say that any more on the air?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Featherstone; and I made it clear to Mark Lane, because I
mentioned his name several times, and he said, "He has told me not to tell
<span class="locked">anyone"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. You mean Featherstone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes; that the shots had come from a window up in the Depository
and for me not to say that any more, that I was wrong about it, and I said
"Very well," and so I just didn't say any more that I ran across the street
to see the man, and that's the part, as much as I can get from when the FBI
men came out and talked to me the other day, that is the part mostly that I got
that was out of context, because what he gave the Commission was basically
true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What Mark Lane gave the Commission?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Except for <span class="locked">what&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Except he didn't have his comments in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. What were his comments?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, as I said, the way he would ask me things I can see why I
gave the answers I did, which to me are the truth, but I can see, taken out of
context, why he or the Commission, well, not how he, because he was listening
to me&mdash;how the Commission could take it to mean maybe something else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he repeat then to the Commission how the Commission could
take them to mean maybe something else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. <span class="locked">Yes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Did he repeat them to the Commission out of context&mdash;did Mark
Lane repeat them out of context?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. To me they were&mdash;to me they were&mdash;it was my comments and it
wasn't everything I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Have you now related all of the ways that Mark Lane took your
comments out of context?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. So far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, is there anything else about your conversation with Mark
Lane which you think would be helpful to the Commission to know about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, before getting on to Mark Lane, we were talking about the
times you had been interviewed by the authorities and you had told me you were
interviewed a couple of times by telephone by the FBI when you called back to
verify it was the FBI and about a single interview you had with the FBI a
week ago today, which would have been the 17th of March?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, have you had any additional interviews with any Federal
authorities before today, other than those which you have already told me about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No; not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Now, for the record, Mrs. Hill, I'm going to ask you some questions
about your own background&mdash;first of all I would like you to tell me how

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is there any unusual status with respect to your being
married at this moment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I am in the process of getting a divorce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how many children have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I have two&mdash;a boy 12 and a girl 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your educational background?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I was graduated from Wewoka High School and Oklahoma Baptist
University in Shawnee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what year did you graduate from high school?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. 1948.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what year from college?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. 1954, after two babies later.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is that a 4-year college?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And how are you occupied at the present time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I taught 7 years in Oklahoma City public schools and for the past
year and a half I have been doing substitute teaching for the Dallas Board

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your maiden name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Lollis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And what is your husband's occupation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. He is a consultant for Science Research Associates, lately IBM.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. And is there anything else that you would care to tell me which
you think might be of aid to the Commission in its investigation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Thank you very much for coming and giving your deposition.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Am I completely through with the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. I think this will be the end of it&mdash;we have all of the records,
and to the best of my expectation&mdash;yes; but you could be called anytime. You
have both the pleasure and the discomfort, but the distinction of having been
an eye witness.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Well, I know, I have always been rather&mdash;I mean, it's not something
you are&mdash;you are not proud to say it, but I think it was part of history
and I was glad I was there, but because I got publicity, because&mdash;I think my
children will be interested to know that someday that I was in it someway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, let me say, as to the best of my knowledge there are no
further plans for the Commission to call you again. This transcript will be
reviewed by me in Washington and by my colleagues in Washington and it is possible
that you may be contacted again. Perhaps I might talk to you again by
telephone or perhaps the FBI, or it is even conceivable the Commission might
want to hear from you, yourself, in Washington, but my best estimate of the situation
right now is that we have the basic information from you which we need.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. I told the FBI the other day I did not want to go to Washington.
I don't think I can take any more laughing at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. Well, we won't call on you unless it is concluded that it is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Good. I was hoping this would do it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. All right. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Specter</span>. For the purposes of the record, this diagram which was used
during the deposition of Mrs. Hill will be marked Hill Exhibit No. 5.</p>

<p>The testimony of Austin L. Miller was taken at 2:40 p.m., on April 8, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you stand and be sworn, sir.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before the
President's Commission is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you state your name for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Austin L. Miller.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. 1006 Powl Circle, Mesquite, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that a suburb of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes; it is just a little town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far out of Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It borders the city limits of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Twenty-six</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to school in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Tenth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I quit school and went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. First worked at Titche's, and then for Robertson &amp; King Motor
Supply, and from there I went back to Titche's, and then to A. &amp; P. Bakery
Co., and then I worked for Presto Delivery Co., and then to Texas-Louisiana
Freight Bureau where I am working now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you been there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Ever since 1958, January 1958.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you do now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, it is a combination job between mail clerk and tariff
compiler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you working on Friday, November 22, 1963, which
was the day that President Kennedy came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Texas-Louisiana Freight Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is that located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. 215 Union Terminal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is the Union Terminal located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That is down at&mdash;the address they give is 400 South Houston
Street, but the book is not the correct address, but that is what they use.
Because 400 is the opposite side of the block, and there is a city park there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What cross street? Would it be near any intersection at all, or
not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. On the corner of Houston, and I can't think of the name of that
street now, right in front of the Dallas Morning News.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be north or south of Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It would be south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many blocks south of Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Four blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Four blocks south of Main Street on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, where were you at about the time the motorcade came
by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I was standing on the top of the triple underpass on the Main
Street side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you say triple underpass, there are actually three
underpasses there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes. They are sitting side by side. It is Main, Commerce, and
Elm. I was over Elm instead of Main Street. I was over Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now there is a place where the railroad tracks are, and that is
the first. Is it all railroad tracks, or part railroad tracks and part freeway?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. All railroad tracks go over that particular set of underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. About 12:15 or 12:20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what time the motorcade came by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No; I don't, not for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how long after you got there did you see the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. About 10 or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone else standing around there that you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Royce Skelton, the boy I work with and an elderly man who is a
building maintenance man. By name, I don't know him, but a lot of other employees
I have seen in the building other than myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone else that you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. As far as knowing, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw other people there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any police officer around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. There was one on both sides of the bridge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, describe what happened. Did you see the motorcade come by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir; it came down Main Street and turned north on Houston
Street and went over two blocks and turned left onto Elm Street.</p>

<p>Got about halfway down the hill going toward the underpass and that is when
as far as I can recall the first shot was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you know it was a shot when you heard it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I didn't know it. I thought at first the motorcycle backfiring or
somebody throwed some firecrackers out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you hear or see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. After the first one, just a few seconds later, there was two more
shots fired or, or sounded like a sound at the time. I didn't know for sure. And
it was after that I saw some man in the car fall forward, and a woman next to
him grab him and hollered, and just what, I don't know exactly what she said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. About that time I turned and looked toward the&mdash;there is a little
plaza sitting on the hill. I looked over there to see if anything was there, who
threw the firecracker or whatever it was, or see if anything was up there, and
there wasn't nobody standing there, so I stepped back and looked on the tracks
to see if anybody run across the railroad tracks, and there was nobody running
across the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>So I turned right straight back just in time to see the convertible take off fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the convertible in which the President was riding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I wouldn't want to say it was the President. It was a convertible,
but I saw a man fall over. I don't know whose convertible it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did the shots sound like they came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Well, the way it sounded like, it came from the, I would say from
right there in the car. Would be to my left, the way I was looking at him over
toward that incline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can think of that you saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. About the time I looked over to the side there, there was a police
officer. No; a motorcycle running his motor under against the curb, and jumped
off and come up to the hill toward the top and right behind him was some more
officers and plainclothesmen, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone that might be, that gave any suspicious movements
of any kind over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone when you looked around on the railroad tracks,
that you hadn't seen before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir; I didn't. We was all standing in one group right at the
rail looking over, and the police officer, he was standing about 5 or 10 feet
behind us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now about how many were there in that group altogether, if you
can remember?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I would say in the neighborhood of 10 or 12 people. Maybe more,
maybe less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Apart from those people, did you see anyone else in the vicinity at
all on the railroad tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. There was one young man or boy. He was going to come up
on the tracks, but the police officer stopped him and asked him where he was
going, and he said he was going to come up where he could see, and he asked
if he worked for the train station, and he said, "No," so the police officer made
him go back down.</p>

<p>Where he went to, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Oh, before the President came along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how much before, do you know? Offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know anything about this man or boy that you described?
About how old he was, or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I can't think. I would say he was in his early twenties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Tall or short?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I don't remember that much about him. I do recall him coming
up and the man talking to him and turning him back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So he went back down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did he come up from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. He came up from the&mdash;I am going by where I was standing.
He was from our left, from around behind that parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see him again or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see anyone else in that area at all or anything on
the railroad tracks at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir; not until after the shots were fired and the police officers
came up the hill and climbed over the fence and started searching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That was the only other people that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. That is all I recall seeing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you can add that might be of help in any
way to the Commission, or to the investigation into the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Offhand, no, sir; I don't recall anything else.</p>

<p>My statement at the time may have some more, but I don't recall exactly
what all did happen for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you and I never met until just a few minutes ago, did we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And as soon as you came in here, we started immediately taking
your testimony under oath, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We never talked about the facts before then, did we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you have the right, if you like, to read this deposition when
it is typewritten, and sign it, or else you can waive the signing of it and have
it go directly to Washington without your signing. What would be your
preference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. If you rather it would be <span class="locked">signed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We do not require it to be signed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. It makes no difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We have no preference. We do not require your signing. You
can waive the signing of it to save yourself a trip coming down here again, or
you have the right, if you like, to come down and read it and sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. I will just waive it, because it would be to my advantage to not
have to take off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, we sure appreciate your coming down and thank you
very much.</p>

<p>There is one other thing. We have a sketch. I want to ask you to put on
the sketch where you were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Okay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you what we call "A. Miller Deposition Exhibit A."
I am going to try and get this thing oriented here.</p>

<p>Here is Houston Street running north this way.</p>

<p>There is Elm. Here is the railroad overpass, and here is the freeway
overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Now where this "X" is at up here, is where we was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where it is marked "Pos. 5," there is an arrow there which I
have put there, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the "X," which appears to be right over the overpass of Elm,
which would be to the east side of the overpass, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Miller</span>. Yes, sir; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, were you working for the Union Terminal
Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were you doing that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. We had been working on the mail conveyor up close to the other
end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Mail conveyor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who were you working with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I was by myself&mdash;it was on a Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About noon did you go down to someplace near Elm Street?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I went over to Mr. Holland's shop and then we went up there
together to see the parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went over to Mr. Holland's office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Mr. Holland's shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is Mr. Holland's occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. He is a signal supervisor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For the Union Terminal Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. We taken a walk up through the overpass right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you stand on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Well, we went over to the railing and stood there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And with reference to what streets&mdash;were you standing over Elm,
over Main, or over Commerce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Well, you mean when this parade came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. We were between them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Between what streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Elm and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a map here which has been used in the deposition of another
witness, but it gives some idea of the location there&mdash;this is north&mdash;this
shows the corner of Elm and Houston Streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it shows where Elm turns and goes under the railroad, the
overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. We were between the two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you take this pen and this is Elm and here is Main, and make
a mark and show me where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. This is the overpass right there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; this is the overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. We was between these two streets&mdash;there was big banisters
up there and it was about like that, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We will put a mark there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. (The witness Reilly marked the instrument as requested by
Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And I will put on that position "7"&mdash;you were standing there
when the motorcade came along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was standing there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I believe it was Mr. Dodd and Skinney.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what are his initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Dick Dodd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's R.&nbsp;C. Dodd, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is his position with the Union Terminal Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Foreman of the laborers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who else was with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. These two fellows here&mdash;were standing out there, but I don't
know their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What are their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I don't know their names&mdash;I don't even associate with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Mr. Holland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. We were together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. S.&nbsp;M. Holland was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. We were together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Holland and Dodd and you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. And me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, there were how many other men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Well, there were three or four&mdash;but I don't know who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have seen two of them here, haven't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes; two of them out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you know one's name <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I wouldn't know it&mdash;their name&mdash;I don't even know their name
only by seeing them. I do go in there in the office once in a while to put in
lamps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the name of Skelton, isn't there a fellow named
Skelton there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And a man named Miller?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you all standing at about the same location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. All right close together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any police officers there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. One behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. He was standing back close to the tracks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. About 8 or 10 feet back of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any other police officers there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. On the far side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean by "far side"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Up to the side of where the tracks are on the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It would be west of where you are standing&mdash;you put a mark
down and show me where the two police officers were standing, as you remember
it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Now, this is all tracks over here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All tracks along the railroad overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes; these are all tracks in here. One of them was standing
behind me and one of them was standing back around here&mdash;back along here,
but just how far back, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a mark down there for me where the two police officers were
standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I have an idea one of them was standing here, and for sure, I
don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the other one standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. He was on the far side, but I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, mark that "8."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. He was on the far side&mdash;and how far back&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean by "far side"? Do you mean he was south of
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. No; he was west of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You see on the map, it's marked "Elm, Main and Commerce"&mdash;this
other police officer was near what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I wouldn't know because I wasn't facing him and there was two
of them up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Back; by "far side" you mean that he was south of you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. No; he was west of me&mdash;you see, this place is east and west&mdash;these
streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But the railroad overpass goes north and south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes; north and south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, if he was west of you, he would be behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes; behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there two police officers behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes; there was two of them&mdash;both of them&mdash;one close and one
<span class="locked">here&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Listen to the question&mdash;there were two police officers there, was
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they both behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One was closer than the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How close was the one that was closer to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I have an idea about 8 or 10 feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how far away was the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. About the width of that overpass across&mdash;75 or 80 feet across
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. One was 8 or 10 feet from you, and the other one was 75 feet from
you and they were both behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the motorcade come down Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. No; not until it turned and started to come under the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you first see it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. When it turned off of Houston Street and started around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Onto Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the first time you saw the President's car, when it turned
off Houston Street onto Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many people were there on the overpass at the time&mdash;at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Just what I told you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Well, there was Holland and me and Dick Dodd and those two
fellows out there and the two policemen&mdash;that's all I remember seeing out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did they seem to come from; what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. It seemed to me like they come out of the trees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What trees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. On the north side of Elm Street at the corner up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the north side of Elm&mdash;on what corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Well, where all those trees are&mdash;you've never been down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; I've been there, but you tell me&mdash;I want you to tell me because
it has to go on the record here and it has to be in writing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Well, it's at that park where all the shrubs is up there&mdash;it's to the
north of Elm Street&mdash;up the slope.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any pigeons fly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. No; I didn't pay no attention to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I just stood there a few minutes and then I went on down to the
shop.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way did you walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. South.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. South?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Toward the post office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your shop is down south of that place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes; it's the other side of the station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who walked with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Nobody.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You walked alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all, Mr. Reilly. This will be written up and you
can look it over and correct it if you wish, or you can waive your signature
if you wish.</p>

<p>Which do you wish&mdash;do you want to come down and sign it, or do you want to
waive your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. No; I'll do anything you want me to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you do anything you want to&mdash;it's your option&mdash;what do you
want to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. I'll sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
This young lady will write it up and call you and you can come down here
and sign it. How is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. Well, will I have to come back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; you will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. It is hard for me to get off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is&mdash;why don't you waive your signature, if it is inconvenient
to you, and we will offer this diagram as Exhibit A to your deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Reilly</span>. All right.</p>

<h2 id="t231"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_EARLE_V_BROWN" id="TESTIMONY_OF_EARLE_V_BROWN">TESTIMONY OF EARLE V. BROWN</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Earle V. Brown was taken at 4:40 p.m., on April 7, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Street, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you please rise, raise your right hand and be sworn?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Sit down. State your name and address, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Earle V. Brown, 618 North Rosemont.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Policeman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been a policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Fourteen years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born and what is your education and training?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I was born on a farm near Lyons, Nebraska, in 1917, and I
completed 12 years of schooling, high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. High school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, I stayed on the farm until 1939, then I moved to Ohio;
Lima, Ohio. I was inducted into the Army and was in there 4 years, 5 months,
discharged 1945, August 15, and I was here in Dallas actually when I was
discharged and then back to Ohio for about 4 years. Then, let's see, that would
be August of 1949, we came back to Dallas and then February 27, 1950, I joined
the police force.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you are a patrolman, aren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1964, were you assigned to a certain post on duty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That would be the railroad overpass over Stemmons Expressway
service road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the one that leads off Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. You mean that crosses Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That crosses Elm, yes; the overpass across Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What does it cross?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. It's over Stemmons Expressway; in other words, they make that
turn off Elm and go up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know where Elm, the corner of Elm and Houston is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then there is a road, the highway continues on to the west, a little
south, is that what you call the Stemmons Expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. There's one there, too, but that overpass is actually a road.
Where I was was the railroad overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The railroad overpass itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far were you from the place where the continuation of Elm
goes under the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Oh, approximately 100 yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me see if we can get something in the record that will be
your position. You were appointed to this particular spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there another patrolman on the overpass also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir; James Lomax.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this is the place where the railroad yards run over the
highway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you are on the Stemmons Freeway end of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That's right; in other words, Stemmons Freeway and the service
road both go under the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. James Lomax.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far were you from the point where Elm Street goes under
the underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I would say approximately 100 yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Approximately 100 yards in what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That would be&mdash;wouldn't be straight east, but it would be to
easterly, kind of off at an angle&mdash;I would say about from us about a 20° angle
to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You would be east or west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. We would be to the southwest of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You would be to the southwest of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, I would say that's about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have the corner of Houston and Elm Street in sight from
where you were located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Actually, we could see cars moving there, you know, coming
and making the turn, but the intersection, that would be about all we probably
could see would be cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see cars going down after they made the turn and
going down toward the underpass south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could see those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have any instructions when you were assigned to this
location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Not allow anyone on the overpass whatever and walk forward
and make both ends&mdash;in other words, check both ends of the overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was you and Mr. Lomax?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there an E.&nbsp;V. Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That's me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's you, and was there also a Joe Murphy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Joe Murphy is a three-wheeler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; where was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I don't know, sir; he was, I believe he was on his three-wheeler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On his motor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I believe; I wouldn't say for sure but I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you people keep people off the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. We made no contact with anyone except one of the railroad
detectives come up there and talked to us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you keep the underpass free of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Underneath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; up above.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Up above; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about underneath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, that was roadway there; people wouldn't be able to walk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the top of the overpass you kept that free of people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have the railroad yards in sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They would be what direction from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That would be east; that would be east of us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. East, maybe a little north?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, the whole thing kind of in that general direction, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any people over in the railroad yards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Not that I recall; now they were moving trains in and out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did not see people standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No, sir; sure didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Everything was in clear view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I withdraw the question. Was there any obstruction of your
vision to the railroad yards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Not the direction of the railroad yard, but at ground level we
didn't have very good view. Mr. Lomax and I remarked that we didn't have
a very good view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that because of the moving trains?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President's motorcade come on to Houston Street
from Elm; were you able to see that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Now they came down Main, didn't they, to Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No, sir; actually, the first I noticed the car was when it stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. After it made the turn and when the shots were fired, it stopped.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it come to a complete stop?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. That, I couldn't swear to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It appeared to be slowed down some?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; slowed down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did they seem to come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, they seemed high to me, actually; if you want, would you
like me to tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Sure, tell it in your own words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, down in that river bottom there, there's a whole lot of
pigeons this particular day, and they heard the shots before we did because I
saw them flying up&mdash;must have been 50, 75 of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the river bottom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. You know, actually off to the&mdash;between us and the, this overpass
you are talking about there's kind of a levee along there. It's really
a grade of the railroad, is what it is; that's where they were and then I heard
these shots and then I smelled this gun powder.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. It come on it would be maybe a couple minutes later so&mdash;at
least it smelled like it to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What direction did the sound seem to come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. It came it seemed the direction of that building, that <span class="locked">Texas&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. School Book Depository?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any pigeons flying around the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I just don't recall that; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way did you look when you heard the sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. When I first heard that sound I looked up toward that building
because actually it seemed to come from there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was it you saw the pigeons rise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. They must have been down there feeding at that time because
they just seemed to all take off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were they from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. From where I was standing they would be about half way
between&mdash;no, they would be up more toward that other overpass, what they
call the triple underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were about 100 yards from the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Approximately; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anybody standing on the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. On the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes, sir; they had at least two officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anybody but police officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Not that I know of. I didn't recall anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, let me see, by that time the escort as to the motorcycles,
we could see them coming, the front part of the motorcade, I don't think they
probably realized what happened; they had come on ahead. And then we saw
the car coming with the President, and as it passed underneath me I looked
right down and I could see this officer in the back; he had this gun and he was
swinging it around, looked like a machinegun, and the President was all
sprawled out, his foot on the back cushion. Of course, you couldn't conceive
anything that happened; of course, we knew something had happened, but we
couldn't conceive the fact it did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you move out of there in any direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No, sir; we, well, we checked there; the area, we kept checking
that area through there and, of course, there were people all over the place but
we didn't allow anybody up on the railroad right-of-way through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anybody standing on the triple underpass at the point
where Elm goes underneath?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Uh-uh, I couldn't recall; no one except police officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. More than one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you search any part of the area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. We were instructed to stay at our posts, which we did, and later
we got instructions to check the area around the Depository, Book Depository
Building, and to obtain the license numbers of all those cars parked around
there, which we did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were any cars parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, there's a parking lot around that building and there was
several cars parked all around that building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You took the license numbers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; in fact, I think there must have been four or five officers
taking license numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long were you around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, we stayed and then they sent us back to the overpass and
we stayed there until, let's see, I don't believe we left there until about 3:30
or 4 in the afternoon, and then we came up to the hall and Mr. Sorrels, I believe
talked to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all, officer. This will be written up and you can take
it, read it, and sign it if you wish, or you can waive your signature, just as
you wish. Which do you wish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. You mean today?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; it will be a week or so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. What preference do I have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, it will be written up and you can come in and sign <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or you can waive signature and you don't need to come in and sign
it. It is your option; you can do either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I will be glad to come in and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She will notify you. Thanks very much.</p>

<p>The testimony of Earle V. Brown was taken at 2:15 p.m., on April 8, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have been sworn, so we will just continue with your deposition,
and your name is Earle V. Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Right; E-a-r-l-e (spelling).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Brown, I have had a map made here which I would like to
have you inspect here. The railroad overpass is shown&mdash;that runs in a north
and south direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Stemmons Freeway overpass is shown&mdash;that runs north and
south, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you on either one of those overpasses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Either one of those two there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. On this overpass here&mdash;this TP Railroad overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The overpass that runs in an east and west direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Right&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, will you take this pen and draw on there your position
on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, you see, on this overpass, of course, there are the tracks
and then there is a railing and then there is a catwalk on each side and we walked
the catwalk, and we would come around on each end and we would walk the
tracks and come around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you saw the President's car turn on Houston
and Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I was on the catwalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you mark your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. I would be&mdash;approximately in the center.
(Instrument marked by the witness, as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you marked the place where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes; it would be about the center of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that where you were when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you see anybody out on the railroad overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No, sir; I didn't see anybody there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't recall seeing anybody that would either be where Elm goes
under the overpass or where Main goes under the overpass&mdash;you don't recall
seeing anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No; I don't recall seeing anyone there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told me yesterday you saw some officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Well, that would be the police officers&mdash;would be the only ones
I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who those officers were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No, sir; at the time I did, but I wouldn't know now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any officer on Stemmons Freeway where we have
positioned (1), (2), and (3) on this diagram?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. No, I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the place where you marked your location&mdash;we will mark that
as Brown Exhibits&mdash;the X marks the position of Brown, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. All right.
(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Brown Exhibit A," for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you very much for coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brown</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Royce G. Skelton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. At the Texas Louisiana Freight Bureau.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you born and where did you come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. I was born in Henrietta, Tex., May 25, 1940.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. I attended all grade schools in Wichita Falls and I graduated
from Wichita Falls High School.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me where you went to school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Wichita Falls through high school and I attended 1 year at
Midwestern University.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when did you go to work for the railroad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. February 1, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work do you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Mail clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, did you watch the parade, the motorcade
of the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes, sir; I went to the triple overpass about 12:20&mdash;I think it
was 12:15, or something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Whom did you go down there with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Austin Miller and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where does he work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. He is a mail clerk also in the same company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you stand to watch the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Well, we were directly over Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Directly over Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Maybe it would be to the left-hand side, if you were on the
street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anybody else there on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. There were quite a few people up there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know any of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Well, I know by sight&mdash;I knew the electrician, an old man that's
an electrician.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Frank Reilly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Is that his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The man that was here a moment ago&mdash;his name is Reilly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. I know him when I see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Yes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. And Austin Miller, of course.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know Dodd, the employee of the railroad?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. No, sir; like I say, I recognized them off and on when I see
them around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any police officers there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes; this man right here&mdash;they say it was him&mdash;I don't recall
whether it was or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who&mdash;Mr. Brown?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. The one who was in here just a while ago&mdash;they say he was the
one up there, but I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't recognize him there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. No; I didn't recognize him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you saw some police officers up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were they standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. There was one standing directly behind me, I think, or in the
general vicinity, and there was one on the far side of the triple underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By "far side," you mean where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. It would be back on this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It would be south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. No, sir; that would be the east side&mdash;isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Elm runs east and west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. It would be the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It would be west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes, sir; and then there was one back over here on Stemmons&mdash;I
noticed one, at least, over there and one on the railroad overpass on Stemmons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many police officers were on this overpass, the railroad overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Two, I would say, sir. That's all I saw.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how many men did you see standing right near on the railroad
overpass over Elm, just approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Eight, including the officer&mdash;eight or nine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President's car turn on Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes, sir; I saw the car carrying the Presidential flag turn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you hear something soon after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Just about the same time the car straightened up&mdash;got around
the corner&mdash;I heard two shots, but I didn't know at that time they were shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did they seem to come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Well, I couldn't tell then, they were still so far from where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the shots sound like they came from where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. No, sir; definitely not. It sounded like they were right there&mdash;more
or less like motorcycle backfire, but I thought that they were these dumbballs
that they throw at the cement because I could see the smoke coming up
off the cement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw some smoke come off of the cement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did it seem to you that the sound came from, what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Towards the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Right around the motorcycles and all that&mdash;I couldn't distinguish
because it was too far away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stand there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. I stood there from about 12:15 until the time the President was
shot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. I think I heard four&mdash;I mean&mdash;I couldn't be sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think you heard four?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay there after you heard the fourth shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Not very long&mdash;just as soon as the cars sped away and everything
was in a big commotion&mdash;we ran down to listen to the radio. We couldn't
get anything off of that&mdash;we heard that the President had been shot and so we
went back up there and the police officer asked us if we had seen the assassination
and we told him we had. He said he would like to get a statement from
us, so he took us over to the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any pigeons flying or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. No, sir; I didn't see anything like that&mdash;any pigeons at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all I have. This will be written up and submitted to
you for your signature, if you want to sign it, or you can waive your signature.</p>

<p>Which do you want to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. I will waive my signature. I am sure it is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is fine. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. There's one thing I could say&mdash;you have that other report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. About when I saw one of the bullets where it hit on the pavement
and it hit, the smoke did come from the general vicinity of where you say
Oswald was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wait a minute&mdash;let me ask you some questions about that.</p>

<p>Tell me, now, about the smoke&mdash;did you see some smoke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. After those two shots, and the car came on down closer to the
triple underpass, well, there was another shot&mdash;two more shots I heard, but
one of them&mdash;I saw a bullet, or I guess it was a bullet&mdash;I take for granted
it was&mdash;hit in the left front of the President's car on the cement, and when
it did, the smoke carried with it&mdash;away from the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean there was some smoke in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. No; on the pavement&mdash;you know, pavement when it is hit with
a hard object it will scatter&mdash;it will spread.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way did it spread?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. It spread just right in line, like you said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I haven't said anything&mdash;tell me what you think it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Like I said&mdash;south of us&mdash;it would be southwest, you know, in
a direct line from the Texas Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. In other words, the spray seemed to go to the west; is that
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. Thanks very much.</p>

<p>I'm going to get you to mark one of these maps and show where you were
standing. Here is Elm and here is the railroad underpass and pay no attention
to the diagrams, but show me about where you were standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. I was about right there (marked instrument referred to as
requested by Counsel Ball).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By that "X" we will put the word "Skelton" and that is where
you were standing with your friend?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Approximately&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you see any smoke or anything from any place around
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. No, sir; I just stated to your secretary that I heard people
say they did, but I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you did see something light on the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. A bullet&mdash;let's see&mdash;this is kind of out of proportion [referring
to diagram], and I would say the bullet hit about right here [indicating on
diagram].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, let's mark that as "Skelton (2)" and we will make the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
Skelton number (1) and then Skelton number (2), and this X mark here
is where you saw the bullet and which way did the spray go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Just like it was going there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mark an arrow showing the direction that you think the spray
was going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. (Marks the diagram with arrow.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's fine, and we will make that as an exhibit Shelton exhibit A
and attach it to your deposition.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as Skelton exhibit A for identification)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you and that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Skelton</span>. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="t239"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_S_M_HOLLAND" id="TESTIMONY_OF_S_M_HOLLAND">TESTIMONY OF S.&nbsp;M. HOLLAND</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of S. M Holland was taken at 2:20 p.m, on April 8, 1964 in the
Office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission. Mr. S M Holland was accompanied by his attorney, Mr. Balford
Morrison.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you rise please and raise your right hand so as to be
sworn.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony that you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Sit down, please.</p>

<p>You have recorded Mr. Morrison's presence?</p>

<p>The Reporter. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr Holland, you have received a letter from the Commission
asking you to come and testify today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As you know, the Commission is inquiring into all of the facts
concerning the assassination of President Kennedy and we want your evidence
concerning what you saw at the time of the assassination from the place you
were standing. May we have, for the record, your name and residence address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. S.&nbsp;M. Holland, 1119 Lucille Street, Irving, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Signal supervisor for Union Terminal Railroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long have you been employed by that organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Union Terminal since 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now on Friday November 22, will you describe what you did concerning
the President's visit and where you were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, about 11:00 o'clock, a couple of policemen and a plain
clothesman came up on top of the triple underpass, and we had some men working
up there, and I knew that they was going to have a parade, and I left my
office, and walked up to the underpass to talk to the policemen. And they
asked me during the parade if I would come back up there and identify people
that was supposed to be on that overpass. That is the railroad people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Where is your office Mr Holland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. At the Union Terminal Station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is that within walking distance of the triple overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes, it is. About&mdash;less than a quarter of a mile, a very short
distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And these policemen that you spoke to, there were 3 altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Two&mdash;there were 2 city policemen and 1 man in plainclothes.
I didn't talk to him. I talked to the city policemen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You don't know what his affiliation was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I know he was a plainclothes detective or FBI agent or some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
thing like that, but I don't know, and I told him I would be back and after
lunch I would go up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Approximately what time did you arrive up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Oh, I arrived up there, I guess, about a quarter until 12,
and I would identify each person that came up there that he worked at the
Union Terminal, and department so-and-so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Whom did you see there at 11:45 when you returned, from then
until 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, I would have to try to remember who all was up there then.
There was Mr. Reilly and Mr. R.&nbsp;C. Dodd.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Reilly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Reilly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Who <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. R.&nbsp;C. Dodd, and N.&nbsp;H. Potter and Luke Winburn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Luke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Winburn.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. And a fellow by the name of Johnson, he works in the car
department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Johnson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. And there was another fellow who worked at the car department,
tall, blond-headed boy, and I can't remember his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That makes six people so far. Are these all employees <span class="locked">of&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Of the terminal?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes, and they were two men, one of them worked for the
Katy, and one for the T. &amp; P., that I don't know their names, but I do know
that they were railroad people. They were over on business. Working on those
business cars, and one of them was a Katy employee, and one was a T. &amp; P.
employee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Could you give me their full names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Texas &amp; Pacific, and the Missouri, Kansas, Texas Railroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You don't know the names of those particular men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you see them here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I know the policemen talked to them and got identification
from them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes; but they are not, as far as you know, the two gentlemen
that you saw sitting in the anteroom to the U.S. attorney's office just <span class="locked">before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No; neither one of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you recognize either of those two men?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. One of them is a cabdriver, and the other one is an electrician
at Union Terminal. The large fellow is a cabdriver.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The electrician, do you know his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Frank Reilly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. There were two other men out there. Perhaps you didn't notice
them. I spoke to them after I spoke to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, at the time the parade got started they was, I guess&mdash;Davey
Cowzert was up there, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But, just to finish with the two, you didn't recognize either of
the two people who were in the anteroom a few moments ago as being people
who were on the overpass that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. There was two people I did recognize and that was the cabdriver
and Mr. Reilly was out there and that policeman, he was up there with
me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You recognized the policeman as being the policeman who was
on the triple overpass at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine. Now, another name just occurred to you of someone else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Cowzert [spelling] C-o-w-z-e-r-t, Cowzert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is he also an employee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes; he is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were all the people there, as far as you know, at the time the
Presidential <span class="locked">motorcade&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Came into view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. One more, if I can remember his name. One that run around
the corner of the fence with me. He was right behind me&mdash;why in the world&mdash;he
was one of the first ones around the fence when we run around the fence
to what was happening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Before we get to that, how about the police. How many police
officers were on the overpass at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. There were two Dallas Police officers up there at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Tell me if this is correct, Mr. Holland. At the time the Presidential
motorcade arrived, to the best of your recollection, on the overpass
there were two uniformed Dallas Police, and the following employees of the
Terminal Co.: Yourself, Mr. Reilly, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Potter, Mr. Winburn, Mr.
Johnson, Mr. Cowzert, and perhaps one other man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So, that would be eight including yourself, plus two employees of
the railroad. One of the T. &amp; P. and one of the Katy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That's right. At that time. Now, like I said a while ago, by the
time they started there was quite a few come up there, but I can't remember
who it was or their names, <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Before the motorcade started?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Before the motorcade started.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. These were people you recognized as employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Some of them, and some of them I did not recognize, but I
think he was asking for credentials.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The uniformed policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes; one on that side, and one on this side to keep <span class="locked">them&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes; and did you participate in identifying people as being terminal
or railroad employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. When they first started arriving, yes; it was my purpose for
going up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So, that it is fair to say that at the time the President's motorcade
turned into this area, there was no one on the overpass that you didn't
know either as Terminal Co. employees, or railroad employees, or as a policeman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Wouldn't be fair to say that, because there was quite a few
came up there right in the last moments.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. There were? Tell us about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That I couldn't recognize. There wasn't too many people
up there, but there were a few that came up there the last few minutes, but
the policemen were questioning them and getting their identification, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Is this just about the time of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Just about the time, or just prior to it, because there was
a few up there that I didn't&mdash;that I didn't recognize myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Had they been, as far as you could tell, checked by the police?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. He was checking them as they came on top of the underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did it seem to you that everybody up there had been checked
by this policeman for identification?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I think everyone was checked by some person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes. Can you estimate the number of people that were on the
overpass immediately as the motorcade came into view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, I would estimate that there was between 14 to 18 people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, where was the motorcade when you first saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Turned off the Main Street&mdash;in front of the county jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Turning right off of Main onto Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. It was coming down Main and turned off of Main onto Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. At that time will you show me on this drawing where you were
and just make a mark and put the No. 1 next to that mark. That is where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
you were at that time? Roughly in the middle of the overpass over Elm
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And where, in relation to the concrete fence <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Picket fence or concrete?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. No; the concrete.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Oh, the concrete banister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The concrete banister. Were you right at the banister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I was; would you like to see the exact location?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. This is my son standing in the exact location I was in [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Off the record a moment.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Back on the record. Well, then, we'll mark this as Exhibit B,
reserving Exhibit A for this drawing, and Exhibit B is a photograph you took
on Saturday, November 23, of your son standing in the position at the banister
of the triple overpass where you were at the time the motorcade came into view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine. That is quite a good picture. At that time, can you
indicate, to the best of your knowledge where other persons were standing on
the overpass, and particularly in relationship to the two police officers who
were on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, as well as I remember, one police officer was standing
right behind me, or pretty close behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Put a "2" where you believe he was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. He was standing in close enough so that he could see, but
he could also see the people, and the other policeman, I think, unless he left immediately
before this happened&mdash;see, when they turned there. I didn't turn
around and look back any more, but the last time I saw this policeman he was
standing over here on this side, about [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Standing almost directly behind you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But, on the other side of the overpass, facing west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes; all this way, across the tracks. See, these are all railroad
tracks, and he was standing over here on this side immediately before
this motorcade turned this. Now, after they turned, I don't know, but&mdash;because
I was watching them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Would you put a "3" where you believe he was standing and can you indicate
on there where you believe the other 12 to 15 or 16 people were who were on
the overpass at this time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were they all standing in one group?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. There was a pretty close group between this column here,
and this place right in there. In other words, if I can&mdash;had a shot of it, we
could find that pretty close. I don't know that I have one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What you have indicated on the drawing is on the part of the
overpass from one side of Elm Street to the other.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes; this is one side of Elm Street, and this would be the
other. If you would get over here there would be a banister or something in
your way, and this is grass out here, and you couldn't get to get too good a view,
and most of the people was from this right in here, over to right in here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. And this bench runs right along similar to that, up here to
this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That is a wooden picket fence that you are describing that runs
from the end of the concrete banister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Over to a <span class="locked">little&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Little house there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. <span class="locked">Little&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. What do they call that thing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Little pavilion? Little concrete pavilion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, what did you observe from that point on, Mr. Holland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, I observed the motorcade when it turned off of Main
Street onto Houston Street and back on Elm Street. There was two young
ladies right across from this sign, which would be, I judge&mdash;would say they
were standing about here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Put No. 4 there, please. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. And the motorcade was coming down in this fashion, and the
President was waving to the people on this side [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That is the north side of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes; on the north side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. And she was looking in this direction [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. "She," is Mrs. Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. His wife. And about that <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was looking in a southern direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. In the southern direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. South side of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. And about that time he went over like that [indicating], and
put his hand up, and she was still looking off, as well as I could tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, when you say, "he went like that," you leaned forward and
raised your right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Pulled forward and hand just stood like that momentarily.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. With his right hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. His right hand; and that was the first report that I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did it sound like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, it was pretty loud, and naturally, underneath this underpass
here it would be a little louder, the concussion from underneath it, it was
a pretty loud report, and the car traveled a few yards, and Governor Connally
turned in this fashion, like that [indicating] with his hand out, and
another report.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. With his right hand out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Turning to his right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. To his right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. And another report rang out and he slumped down in his seat,
and about that time Mrs. Kennedy was looking at these girls over here [indicating].
The girls standing&mdash;now one of them was taking a picture, and the
other one was just standing there, and she turned around facing the President
and Governor Connally. In other words, she realized what was happening, I
guess.</p>

<p>Now, I mean, that was apparently that&mdash;she turned back around, and by
the time she could get turned around he was hit again along in&mdash;I'd say along in
here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How do you know that? Did you observe that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I observed it. It knocked him completely down on the floor.
Over, just slumped completely over. That <span class="locked">second&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you hear a third report?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I heard a third report and I counted four shots and about the
same time all this was happening, and in this group of trees&mdash;[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, you are indicating trees on the north side of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. These trees right along here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Let's mark this Exhibit C and draw a circle around the trees
you are referring to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Right in there. (Indicating.)</p>

<p>There was a shot, a report, I don't know whether it was a shot. I can't
say that. And a puff of smoke came out about 6 or 8 feet above the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
right out from under those trees. And at just about this location from where I
was standing you could see that puff of smoke, like someone had thrown a firecracker,
or something out, and that is just about the way it sounded. It wasn't
as loud as the previous reports or shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What number would that have been in <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, that would&mdash;they were so close together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. The second and third or the third and fourth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. The third and fourth. The third and the fourth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So, that it might have been the third or the fourth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. It could have been the third or fourth, but there were definitely
four reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You have no doubt about that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I have no doubt about it. I have no doubt about seeing that
puff of smoke come out from under those trees either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Mr. Holland, do you recall making a statement to an agent of
of the FBI several days after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I made a statement that afternoon in Sheriff Bill Decker's
office, and then the Sunday or the Sunday following the Friday, there were
two FBI men out at my house at the time that Oswald was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you tell them that you heard distinctly four shots at that
time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You were certain then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I was certain then and I&mdash;in that statement I believe that
<span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Well, the FBI report that I have said that you heard either
three or four shots fired together, and I gather the impression of the agent
was that you were uncertain whether it was three or four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. At the time I made that statement, of course, I was pretty
well shook up, but I told the people at the sheriff's office, whoever took the statement,
that I believed there was four shots, because they were so close together,
and I have also told those two, four, six Federal men that have been out there
that I definitely saw the puff of smoke and heard the report from under those
trees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you realize that these were shots then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes; I think I realized what was happening out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. When Governor Connally was knocked down in the seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What did you then do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, immediately after the shots was fired, I run around the
end of this overpass, behind the fence to see if I could see anyone up there
behind the fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That is the picket fence?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That is the picket fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. On the north side of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Of course, this was this sea of cars in there and it was just
a big&mdash;it wasn't an inch in there that wasn't automobiles and I couldn't see
up in that corner. I ran on up to the corner of this fence behind the building.
By the time I got there there were 12 or 15 policemen and plainclothesmen,
and we looked for empty shells around there for quite a while, and I left
because I had to get back to the office. I didn't give anyone my name. No
one&mdash;didn't anyone ask for it, and it wasn't but an hour or so until the deputy
sheriff came down to the office and took me back up to the courthouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did he know you personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No, no; he had to find me and find where I was. He didn't
know me, and I don't know who told me they wanted me over at the courthouse,
so, I went back up there with him and made out the statement, and made&mdash;made
out the statement before they found out the results on the shots, or before that
Oswald had even shot that policeman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
I was making out the statement before that, so, it was immediately after the
motorcade had passed through there.</p>

<p>Mr <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What was your impression about the source of these noises, if
you had one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, the impression was that the shots, the first two or three
shots came from the upper part of the street, now, from where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. East on Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes, up in here somewhere. [Indicating.] I didn't have the
least idea that it was up any higher, but I thought the shot was coming&mdash;coming
from this crowd in here [indicating]. That is what it sounded like to me from
where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You are indicating on this Exhibit C. Why don't you put a square
around the area that you just pointed to. You had no idea, I take it, that the
shots were coming from your area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It is your impression that they did not, could not, as far as the
sound was concerned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. As far as the sound was concerned they did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you see anything on the overpass that seemed to you any way
unusual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Oh, no; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Back on the record. Now, Mr. Holland, I'm showing you a copy
of an affidavit which I am marking as Exhibit D. That is the affidavit you made
that you described a few moments ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you read that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. "I am signal supervisor for the Union Terminal, and I was
inspecting signal and switches and stopped to watch the parade. I was standing
on the top of the triple underpass and the President's car was coming down
Elm Street, and when they got just about to the arcade, I heard what I thought
for a moment was a firecracker and he slumped over and I looked over toward
the arcade and trees and saw a puff of smoke come from the trees and I heard
three more shots after the first shot but that was the only puff of smoke I saw.
I immediately ran around to where I could see behind the arcade and did not see
anyone running from there. But the puff of smoke I saw definitely came from
behind the arcade to the trees. After the first shot the President slumped over
and Mrs. Kennedy jumped up and tried to get over in the back seat to him and
then the second shot rang out. After the first shot the Secret Service man
raised up in the seat with a machine gun and then dropped back down in the
seat. And they immediately sped off. Everything is spinning in my head and
if I remember anything else later I will come back and tell Bill."</p>

<p>That is Mr. Decker. And&mdash;brother it was, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I'm sure it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Stand there and watch two or three men get <span class="locked">killed&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Now, that statement makes clear that you heard four shots,
thought you heard four shots at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. But, two of them was rather close together, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So close do you think that might have been one shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No, it was four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You are clear there were four?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No; it was different sounds, different reports.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right. Mr. Morrison, are there any questions you would like
to ask Mr. Holland to clarify any points that we discussed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. Mr. Holland, is there anything you might add to this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, the only thing that I remember now that I didn't then,
I remember about the third car down from this fence, there was a station wagon
backed up toward the fence, about the third car down, and a spot. I'd say 3
foot by 2 foot, looked to me like somebody had been standing there for a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
period. I guess if you could count them about a hundred foottracks in that
little spot, and also mud up on the bumper of that station wagon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This was a car back&mdash;parked behind the picket fence? Well,
why don't you put the Number "5" approximately where that car would have
been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. If we could call this the arcade [indicating]&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. And one, two, three, I think it would have been just about
here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. That is Elm Street. It would be behind the fence, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, I have got the fence running up here, and this car would
be back in there [indicating]. This is the trees out here, which would&mdash;and
that is approximately the same location as&mdash;the car and the trees that I saw
the smoke would probably be the same location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right. And this was a station wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Now, the reason I didn't think so much about that at the time,
was because there was so many people out there, and there was law enforcement
officers and I thought, well, if there is anything to that they would pick that up,
or notice it, but it looks like someone had been standing there for a long time,
because it was muddy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Tracks you saw in the mud?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. It was muddy, and you could have if you could have counted
them, I imagine it would have been a hundred tracks just in that one location.
It was <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And then you saw some mud on the bumper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Mud on the bumper in two spots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. As if someone had cleaned his foot, <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Well, as if someone had cleaned their foot, or stood up on the
bumper to see over the fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Because, you couldn't very well see over it standing down in
the mud, or standing on the ground, and to get a better view you <span class="locked">could&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Was there anything else you noticed about this station wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Do you recall <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. They searched all the cars in that location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did this occur to <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. It occurred to me immediately when I saw it there; yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you thought about it later in the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I thought about it that night.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. In fact, I went to bed&mdash;it was about a week there I couldn't
sleep, much, brother, and I thought about it that night, and I have thought about
it a lot of times since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you ever go back to look at that site or look at the station
wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No; I didn't go back that afternoon, because I spent the rest
of the day in the county jail office over there, but a number of your Federal
Agents went out there then and Secret Service men. It was just a beehive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. In a matter of a few minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you tell any of the Federal officers, or any of the Dallas Police
officers about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I don't think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This is really the first <span class="locked">time&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. This is the first time that I have discussed it, that I remember.
Now, I might have told in our conversation. I don't remember that, but I don't
think I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I am not aware of any other occasion in which you did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. You thought the officers there would take care of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I thought that the officers would take care of it because there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
were so many there, I thought they would take care of everything, and a layman
didn't have any business up there, and I went on back to my office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you ran behind the picket fence after the shots were fired,
did you come near the area where the station wagon was parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Went up to behind the arcade as far as you could go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So, you would have passed where this station wagon was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Or, that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes; immediately, but I turned around, see, and went to
searching in there for empty shells, and three or four agents there then and that
is when I walked back to the car there and noticed the tracks there in one little
spot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When you first came around, that was quite soon after the shots
were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And did you notice anything about this station wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I was in front of the cars, then I went in front of the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In front of the <span class="locked">cars&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. The cars they were parked pretty close to the fence, and I came
up in front of the cars and got over to the fence and then walked back down
looking around, just like the rest of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And that was later you came behind the station wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Oh, maybe 3 or 4 minutes after I got up there, and 3 or 4 minutes
after I got up to the end of the fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. This number of cars, this is an area in which cars are regularly
parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. A parking area for the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No; it is a parking area for the sheriff's department and people
over to the courthouse. They park in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Sheriff's department parks in there. District attorneys' cars
park in there. It is railroad property, but they let them park in there and save
that 25 cents. Don't put that down. Might get in trouble.</p>

<p>Now, do you want to know about the two policemen that were riding in that
motorcade and one of them throwed the motorcycle down right in the middle
of the street and run up towards that location with his gun in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. <span class="locked">Toward&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. The location <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Where you saw the puff of smoke?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. Where I saw the puff of smoke. And another one tried to ride
up the hill on his motorcycle and got about halfway up there and he run up the
rest of the way on foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Go ahead. This is at the time of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. At the time of <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. That the shots were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. The shots was fired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Two motorcycle policemen who were in the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. In the motorcade, and one of them throwed his motorcycle down
right in the middle of the street and ran up the incline with his pistol in his hand,
and the other motorcycle policeman jumped over the curb with his motorcycle
and tried to ride up the hill on his motorcycle, and he&mdash;tipped over with him
up there, and he ran up there the rest of the way with <span class="locked">his&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you see anything further involving those two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No; I ran around, I was going around the corner of the fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. When they were coming up the incline?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. When that happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But, nothing further came of that, that you observed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you talk to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Anything else occur to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. No; that is about all of it. If I have been of any help, I am
tickled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You certainly have. I appreciate very much your coming here
today. Our reporter, Mr. Holland, will transcribe your testimony, and you then
have the opportunity of reviewing it and signing it, or if you prefer you can
waive your signature and she will send it directly to the Commission. Either
one, it is entirely up to you, whichever you prefer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. I prefer that he read it and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Fine. Then the reporter will get in touch with you as soon as his
transcript is ready to read.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. I would like to say&mdash;now, you will cooperate with the authorities
in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I surely will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. To clear this up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. I sure will.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. And you and have&mdash;you and I have been close personal friends
for over 10 years, haven't we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. And you wanted me to come down here because you thought
you would be nervous, and if I were with you maybe you would be less nervous?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Holland</span>. That's correct, because I was real nervous when I went over to
that sheriff's office that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Morrison</span>. I believe that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you&mdash;the overpass runs in a north-south direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you call it the triple overpass, why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Three streets coming through there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What are they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Commerce, Main, and Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have a map that I will&mdash;just a moment. I will get it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me where you were standing on the triple overpass about the
time that the President's motorcade came into sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. I was standing approximately along the&mdash;I believe the south
curb of Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir; at the east&mdash;be the east side of the overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's go back on the record. Now, we have a map here which we
will mark as Exhibit A for your deposition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it shows the railroad overpass running in a north and south
direction, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Over that pass come trains into the yard, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that yard is to the north and west of the Texas Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Well, that whole thing, they have yards all over up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In what general direction from the Texas School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. They have yards to the north, and some to the south of it down
below the Terminal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There are yards south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. They have yards here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is north and west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And also south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you see the President's motorcade come into sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see it? Where was it when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. When I first saw it it was coming off of Main Street onto Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you keep it in sight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir; it was in sight most of the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, where were you standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Standing along the east curb of&mdash;east side of the overpass over
Elm Street there. About the south curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Over, above the south curb of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you put a mark on there? Mark an "X" where you were
standing and write your initials right next to that "X".</p>

<p>J.&mdash;what are the initials?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. J. W.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. J.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;F. That marks where you were standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Approximately; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you keep the President's motorcade in sight after it turned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Other than watching the men that were standing on the overpass
there with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you had instructions to keep all unauthorized personnel off
of that overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you permit some people to be there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. People that were working for the railroad there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there many people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. About 10 or 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were they standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. They were standing along the east banister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The east banister?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir; in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In front of you. Will you make a mark there and show the general
area where they were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. They were standing along this area here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have marked a series of X's to show where about 10 people
were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you looking toward them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have another officer with you there on that duty that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Not on that side. He was on the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was on the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. J.&nbsp;C. White.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know exactly where he was when you were at the position
you have indicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No; I don't. The only thing I know, he was supposed to be on the
west side of the banister.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were looking to the east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, tell me what you saw happen after the President's car
passed&mdash;turned onto Elm from Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. After he came onto Elm I was watching the men up on the track
more than I was him. Then I heard a loud noise, sound like a large firecracker.
Kind of dumbfounded at first, and then heard the second one. I moved to the
banister of the overpass to see what was happening. Then the third explosion,
and they were beginning to move around. I ran after I saw what was happening.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see was happening?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Saw the President slump over in the car, and his head looked
just like it blew up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw that, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Well, at that time I broke and ran around to my right&mdash;to the
left&mdash;around to the bookstore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you have any opinion at that time as to the source of the
sounds, the direction of the sounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. It came from back in toward the corner of Elm and Houston
Streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was your impression at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was any shot fired from the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anyone with a weapon there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or did you hear any sound that appeared to come from the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Went on around the back side of the bookstore.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Immediately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody coming out of that side of the bookstore?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Backside? What do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Well, I guess you would say the northwest side of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any people in the railroad yards around the bookstore
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir. There was a pretty good crowd beginning to gather
back in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you seen anybody over at the railroad yard north and west
of the bookstore before you heard the shots fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No; other than people that had come up there and I sent them
back down the roadway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. People had attempted to get on the overpass there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you had sent them away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you got over to the School Book Depository Building, what
did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. I was standing around in back there to see that no one came out,
and the sergeant came and got me and we were going to check the&mdash;all the railroad
cars down there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was that sergeant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Sergeant came up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you search the railroad cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No; he sent me back down to the inspector. Told me to report
back to Inspector Sawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. At the front of the Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to Sawyer there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell your sergeant or Sawyer, either one where you thought
the shots came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you then tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Told them it came from that vicinity up around Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell the sergeant that first, or did you tell that to Sawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Told that to Inspector Sawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told that to Sawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell that to the sergeant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. I don't know whether I told the sergeant that or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. I moved to&mdash;down the roadway there, down to see if I could find
where any of the shots hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Find anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir. Found where one shot had hit the turf there at the
location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Hit the turf?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any marks on the street in any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, a manhole cover. It was hit. They caught the manhole
cover right at the corner <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw a mark on a manhole cover did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a picture here of a concrete slab, or manhole cover.
Do you recognize that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does the picture show&mdash;tell me what it shows there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. This looks like the corner here where it penetrated the turf
right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. See any mark on the manhole cover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, sir; I don't. Not on the&mdash;well, it is on the turf, on the concrete,
right in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you put an arrow showing the approximate place you saw
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Should have been approximately along here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Make it deep enough to make a mark. The arrow marks the position
that you believe you saw a mark on the pavement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was not on the manhole cover?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Went into the turf?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you recover any bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, sir. It ricocheted on out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have the crime lab make a picture of that spot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. I called them to the location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And told them to make a picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. No, I didn't tell them. Called them to the spot and let them take
it. Can I see the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, sir. Is this the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. That resembles the picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I offer this as "B," then. Mark it as "B" so that we have "A"
and "B" now.</p>

<p>Officer, this will be written up and submitted to you for your signature and
you can read it over and change it any way you wish, or you may waive your
signature at this time, which do you prefer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Well, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Suit yourself. You make the choice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. I would just as soon go ahead and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. We will notify you and you can get in here and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you. One moment, please.</p>

<p>Who gave you your assignment, Mr. Foster?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Sergeant Harkness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did permit some railroad employees to remain on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you determine they were railroad employees?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Foster</span>. By identification they had with them. Identification they had
and the other men that was with them verifying that they were employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay.</p>

between the location I was standing and the area from which the procession
was traveling, and&mdash;a big long freight train, and I did not see it.</p>

side of the Depository Building. On the northwest side of the book store up
there with the rest of the officers and after about 30 minutes they told me
to go out and work traffic at Main and Houston, and I stood out there and worked

Is that correct?</p>

Texas and New Mexico League. After that I went to work for the Humble Oil
and Refining Co. in Baytown. I was down there about 2 years and came back to
Dallas and then I went to work on the police force.</p>

keep traffic moving until the motorcade arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you have a map here which you have drawn for us to show<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any other officers on that overpass?</p>

slow traffic or to stop traffic whenever the motorcade entered the Stemmons
Freeway north entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now where were they located&mdash;and, did they as the motorcade came
down Elm Street, did they go into the highway and stop traffic?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes; they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you put their positions on the Stemmons Freeway overpass
at the time the motorcade came west on Elm, and mark it (2) and (3).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. (Marked diagram as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the names of those officers that were (2) and (3)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. I can't recall. I know them but I can't recall who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they three-wheeler officers too, do they drive three-wheelers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. I believe both of them three-wheelers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And as the motorcade came west on Elm, did they stop traffic on
Stemmons Freeway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes, their main job was to slow it and let the officers farther
down the freeway&mdash;they would stop it, but traffic approaches pretty fast and
they were to slow traffic and let the officers then stop it. They did&mdash;they&mdash;they
stepped into and were slowing the traffic as the motorcade came under that
railroad overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ever stop traffic completely?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, it stopped&mdash;it stopped itself back down when all the
excitement&mdash;someone down there&mdash;they blocked the whole street and then it
backed up, is what it did&mdash;backed up to our position.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On Stemmons Freeway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now Position (1) is where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any people standing on the overpass over Elm, on the
Stemmons Freeway overpass over Elm, as the motorcade came down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No; there was no one standing there prior to the arrival of
the motorcade or after the motorcade arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The only one standing there was you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. It was me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, let's go to the railroad overpass, and first of all, as you
turned west on Elm from Houston, what is the first overpass that you encounter?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. There is a railroad overpass&mdash;all of the trains entering and
leaving the Union Station cross over that overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any officers on that overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. There were two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you mark their positions, approximately, as you saw them
before the motorcade arrived?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. As best I could see&mdash;one was on each side&mdash;one here and one
over on this side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, mark the position of the officer on the west side as
Position (4), and the one on the east side as Position (5).</p>

<p>(The Witness Murphy marked the diagram as requested by Counsel Ball.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were these uniformed officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes, they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they have three-wheelers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No; I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, were there any other people besides the two officers on this
railroad overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. There were about 8 or 10&mdash;from what I could see&mdash;about 8
or 10 men dressed in the overalls and they appeared to be railroad employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you mark in their positions, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, they were in a group right in the center of Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were all together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes; it appeared that they were in a group (Witness Murphy
drew circle indicating presence of persons heretofore mentioned as requested
by Counsel Ball).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have drawn a circle there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And mark that (6).</p>

<p>(Witness Murphy marked the diagram as requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in that circle there were about how many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. 8 to 10 persons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There were 8 to 10 persons approximately, dressed in overalls?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any other people on the railroad overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see the motorcade on Houston from your position (1)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes; I could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President's car turn the corner of Main and
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was in your view, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes; it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the corner of Houston and Elm within your view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Just a portion of it&mdash;you lose sight of it there for just a few
seconds, as it makes the turn. Well, you lose sight of it. There is some kind
of a&mdash;on that part there is a concrete, oh, I don't know what you would call
it&mdash;kind of a framework&mdash;it appears to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, there is an obstruction to your view?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From where you were standing at Position (1)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the corner of the intersection of Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you able to see the President's car after it had turned west
on Elm from Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, again there, you just get a very short view of it before
it goes out of sight then, going down that hill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard shots, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, from the time you saw the President's car turn north on
Houston from Main and until you heard the shots, what direction were you
looking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. I was looking in an easterly direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Toward what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Toward the motorcade&mdash;towards the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you keep the motorcade in sight at all times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes, I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything unusual occur in this group of railroad men
where you have marked Position (6)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No, I didn't&mdash;I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anybody armed there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No, not that I could tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me what direction the policemen were looking who
were at Position (4) and (5)?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. They appeared to be looking in an easterly direction also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The direction of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you see other individuals on that railroad overpass except
the ones you have described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No, just that group that I have described.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you say you heard something&mdash;heard shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Describe to me your best recollection as to what you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, I heard&mdash;I knew they were shots as soon as I heard them,
but I thought at first it was&mdash;it sounded like a shotgun, and then I got the three
shots and there were so many echoes and everything&mdash;then I did determine
it sounded more like a rifle. I do quite a bit of hunting and I determined it
sounded more like a rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Those shots came from what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, just from the direction I was looking&mdash;that's all I could
tell. They came from an easterly direction, from where I was standing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were there echoes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes, quite a few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the men who were on the overpass at Position (5) do anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. I don't recall&mdash;on that overpass&mdash;right after the shots, I did
see then a group of people running up the side of this embankment on Elm
and running. That would be here&mdash;right in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To the north of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. To the north of Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you put an arrow showing the direction they were running
and mark that arrow as "7"&mdash;that's the direction you saw people running?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. (Marked diagram as requested by Counsel Ball.) Yes, they
were running up in this direction and then in behind this Book Depository. Oh,
I could tell a lot of them were photographers, because I could see their cameras
in their hands and then a number of other people, and then I did see some
officers also running in that direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see what the railroad men did who were at Position (6)
on your map?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No; because right at that time that traffic began backing up
on the freeway and I had turned in to try to keep them moving, but I found
that I couldn't move them because it was blocked down below me, north of
me and there was traffic just stacked up from where the other officers had it
stopped there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay at your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, I stayed until, I guess, it was about maybe 3 minutes after
we heard the shots and then the broadcast came over the radio that there had
been a shooting&mdash;the President had been shot&mdash;and then I went towards the
Book Depository.</p>

<p>I got on my motor and went towards the Book Depository then&mdash;off of the
freeway; and then was there up around the Book Depository for the next&mdash;I
would say hour or hour and a half at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to any witnesses?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. I did pick up or talk to three or four people that said they had
seen things and said they heard different things, and I took them to the sheriff's
office across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you knew what their names were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No, sir; I couldn't tell you. I turned them over to the investigators
there with the sheriff's department&mdash;the district attorney's investigators,
that's who they were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't make any notes of their names?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember now what any of them told you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, one man in particular&mdash;he was standing on Elm&mdash;he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
standing right about here where we have marked Position (7), and he claimed
that he heard two shots above him and behind him, and one shot from up
around the edge of this park, and another man claimed that he had been
standing nearly in this same position&mdash;he was standing here on the street and
he claimed that all the shots he heard came from overhead to his rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be near the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes, towards that Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go on the police radio and make any announcement or
statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. No, sir; I didn't. It was so jammed, I didn't make any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I would like to have this marked as Exhibit A to your deposition,
which is illustrative of your testimony.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as Murphy Exhibit No. A, for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be written up and you can come in and look it over and
sign it if you wish, or you can waive signature if you wish. It is your option&mdash;what
would you like to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, if it's necessary, I will sign it. If it isn't, that's perfectly
all right with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It isn't necessary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Well, that's all right then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, you will waive signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thanks very much for coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Murphy</span>. All right&mdash;certainly.</p>

please?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony that you're about to give is the

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what's your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Deputy Sheriff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For the Dallas County Sheriff's Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you, Mr. Craig?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. 27.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you raised here in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No. I was born in Wisconsin, raised in Minnesota; and ran away
from home when I was 12 and traveled all over the country.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you were 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any further schooling after you were 12&mdash;or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I took high school equivalent test in the Service in Japan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
when&mdash;uh&mdash;I was 19, and passed it and got my high school equivalent test&mdash;I
mean, my diploma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you in the Service, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what branch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I was in the Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And how long were you in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before you joined the Army, what did you do? Were you living
with anyone or were you on your own&mdash;or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I was married to a girl who lived out in Mesquite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Mesquite. It's a suburb of Dallas. It's not a town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Well, let me go back a little bit. You said you ran away from home when
you were 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then where did you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I lived in South Dakota, worked on ranches up there, and then
Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, with any relatives&mdash;or were they friends, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No, no; just jobs. Just working here and there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you were married when you <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. 16.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 16. And where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Here in Texas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Here in Texas.</p>

<p>And then you enlisted in the Army when?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I volunteered for the draft when I was 17.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you went in the Service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And served overseas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were discharged when, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. In&mdash;uh&mdash;October of 1955, I believe. In September or October of
1955, sir, is when I got out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it an honorable discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you were in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I served in the&mdash;uh&mdash;motor pool of the 92d Armored Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And, after you got out of service, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, jobs were kind of hard to get. I got a job as a dishwasher
in a cafe, then cook. Then I did construction work for a while. And then I went
to work for the Purex Corporation out on Storey Lane here in Dallas&mdash;2929
Storey Lane. Then I worked for them for about 3½ years. Then, I came down to
the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, what would your job have been there with the Purex Corp.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Packager. I just packaged the Purex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And when did you go to work for the Dallas County Sheriff's
Office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. In October&mdash;October the 9th of 1959.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you've been there ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Family?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; I have a girl and a boy and a stepboy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mr. Craig, I want to take you back to November 22d, 1963,
and ask you whether or not you were working at the sheriff's office that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where is the sheriff's office located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. 505 Main Street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where is 505 Main Street? Is it on the north or the south
side of Main?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It's on the north side of Main at the corner of Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It runs from Houston east to Record Street there? Is that
Record Street there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; the sheriff's office actually runs north from Main over to Elm
Street. It covers that entire block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far east does it go&mdash;or is it just a half-block east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; it's just a half block to&mdash;uh&mdash;well, it's divided, then the
Records Building begins and goes on to Record Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To Record Street.</p>

<p>Well, will you state what you did that day from about noon on&mdash;on
November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I stood out in front waiting for the President's motorcade. I went
out there about&mdash;oh&mdash;5 minutes after 12, I guess; waited directly in front of
the front door on the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be on the north curb of Main?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, we waited there for several minutes&mdash;and&mdash;uh&mdash;the motorcade
finally came by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how fast was the motorcade going when you saw it on
Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Oh, just barely moving. I don't know. It was just barely moving.
I couldn't judge any miles per hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, 5, 10, 15, 20&mdash;what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Probably going&mdash;probably 3 or 4 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You saw the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw the motorcade reach the intersection of Main and
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then it turned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Turned north on Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how fast was it going as it turned north on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Oh, about the same. They&mdash;uh&mdash;they were going about the same
speed as they made the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there any motorcycle policemen alongside the President's
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Uh&mdash;not directly beside it. They was, I believe, on the front part
of it and&mdash;uh&mdash;I believe behind it&mdash;just a little ways behind the back fender
there was a motorcycle officer&mdash;one on each side of the car, as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The ones on the front&mdash;where would the back wheels of the
motorcycles have been with relation to the front wheels of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Uh&mdash;just in front of the bumper because they came by and moved
everybody back, you know, as the car approached us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what about the motorcycles that were just behind the car?
Where were the front wheels of those motorcycles with relation to the back
wheels or the back bumper of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. About equal to the back bumper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You saw the President's car, then, turn north on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then, would you describe what you saw and heard and did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, there were several other cars that came by and&mdash;uh&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you watch those?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Some of them we watched. We watched Mr. Decker's car, of
course, and a few of the others.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, where was Mr. Decker's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I believe he came by just before the President's. I believe there
were some dignitaries and things before that, and then we watched the President's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
and&mdash;uh&mdash;oh, and then about two or three cars after the President's car
had passed. And then we were just standing there looking around, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Then I heard an explosion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you heard the explosion, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, the first&mdash;nothing. I wrestled with my mind. I knew it
was a shot but&mdash;uh&mdash;I didn't want to believe it. But, a few seconds later, I
heard another explosion and, this time, I knew it was a shot. And, as I began
to run, I heard a third one. I was running toward Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many explosions did you hear altogether?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far were these noises apart?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. The first one was&mdash;uh&mdash;about three seconds&mdash;2 or 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Two or 3 seconds between the first and the second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, it was quite a pause between there. It could have been a
little longer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And what about between the second and third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Not more than 2 seconds. It was&mdash;they were real rapid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I continued running across Houston Street, across the parkway,
across Elm Street and, by this time, the motorcade had went on down Elm
Street and I ran up to the railroad yard and&mdash;uh&mdash;started to look around when
the people began to all travel over that way. So, I began moving people back
out of the railroad yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did the noises or shots sound to you like they came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It was hard to tell because&mdash;uh&mdash;they had an echo, you know.
There was actually two explosions with each one. There was the&mdash;uh&mdash;the shot
and then the echo from it. So, it was hard to tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did people tell you, as you ran over there, where they thought
the shots came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; as I reached the railroad yard, I talked to a girl getting
her car that&mdash;uh&mdash;thought they came from the park area on the north side of
Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did she say why she thought they came from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; she was standing there and it sounded real loud at that particular
<span class="locked">point&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. And she thought that's where they came from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone say they had seen anything&mdash;such as a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; later on. A few minutes after that&mdash;I had taken this girl
to one of our criminal investigators&mdash;and was talking to some other people.
I talked to a young couple and the boy said he saw two men on the&mdash;uh&mdash;sixth
floor of the Book Depository Building over there; one of them had a rifle
with the telescopic sight on it&mdash;but he thought they were Secret Service agents on
guard and didn't report it. This was about&mdash;uh&mdash;oh, he said, 15 minutes before
the motorcade ever arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if that boy's name would have been Arnold
Rowland&mdash;(spelling) R-o-w-l-a-n-d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Does that sound like it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; it sounds like the name&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. His wife might be Barbara Rowland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; I believe her name was Barbara.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before you talked to this couple, did you do anything else or
talk with anyone before you got back with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, I looked around, you know, for just&mdash;after I turned this
girl over to Mr. Lewis&mdash;I began looking around and talking to people to see
if they'd seen anything. And that's when I ran onto this man and his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And about what time do you think this was in relation to&mdash;from
when you heard the shots to the time that you talked to this young couple?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I don't know. 10 minutes, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You believe you talked to this young couple 10 minutes after
the shots were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It might have been 10 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then, what did you do? But, first of all, let me ask you this: Did this
girl say that she saw any person with a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, the boy&mdash;where did he say that he saw the man with the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. On the&mdash;uh&mdash;west end of the building on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that be&mdash;when you say "the west end,"&mdash;you mean, the
west end of the south side, or the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. The west end of the south side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he point out the window to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the west corner, where would this window have been?
Right next to the west corner or two or three windows away, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It was the&mdash;uh&mdash;the second window from the corner.</p>

<p>They were walking, you know, back and forth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He said that the two men were walking back and forth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when you talk about second window, this building is located
near you, is it not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This is the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Each window was sort of a pair of windows. And, on the south
side, there probably are around seven pairs of windows.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this have been&mdash;when you say "the second window from
the west end"&mdash;by that do you mean it was the first pair of windows but the
easternmost one of that pair, or do you mean it was in the second pair of windows
from the west end&mdash;or don't you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I don't remember that now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Did he say anything else about what he had seen with this man with the
rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yeah; he said he looked back a few minutes later and&mdash;uh&mdash;the
other man was gone, and there was just one man&mdash;the man with the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He said he looked back again and just the man with the rifle
was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say how long or when the last time was that he saw the
man with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I believe this second time he looked was the&mdash;uh&mdash;the last time
he looked up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And about how long was that before the shots were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, he said he first seen him&mdash;saw the two men about 15 minutes
before the motorcade arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. And he didn't say how long after that he looked back up there
to just see the one man. He just said&mdash;uh&mdash;a few minutes later he looked
back up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A few minutes later, he looked back up and he saw one man
with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Just the one man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say what the one man was doing with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. He said he was holding it down to his side and just looking out
the window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say how far the man was from the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; huh-uh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say in what direction the man was looking out the
window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. He was looking out in a southerly direction. Straight ahead.
You know, straight out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he said the man was holding it at his side, would this be&mdash;did
he say it was, in military terminology, in any kind of a position to hold a
weapon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; this I don't go into with him. I turned him over to Officer
Lewis for interrogation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this be Deputy Sheriff Lemmy Lewis&mdash;(spelling) L-e-m-m-y
L-e-w-i-s?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He is a criminal investigator of the Dallas Sheriff's Office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then you left this young couple?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, about how long would this have been after the shooting
that you left them with Deputy Sheriff Lewis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, I didn't talk with them long. I talked with them&mdash;all
the time that he told me what he saw and the time that I turned him over to
officer Lewis, was probably&mdash;uh&mdash;3 minutes&mdash;3 or 4 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Because&mdash;uh&mdash;I took him immediately up there to him when
he told me what he'd seen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By this time, had anyone said the shots might have come from
that School Book Depository Building&mdash;do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No. I don't&mdash;uh&mdash;I don't recall that. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At this time, do you know whether or not they had sealed off in
any way the entrance or the building&mdash;the School Book Depository Building&mdash;
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; no. I didn't notice that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't notice that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, about how many minutes after the assassination
or shooting was it that you turned this couple over to Sheriff Lemmy Lewis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Oh, it was about&mdash;well, I guess, 12 minutes&mdash;10, 12 minutes.
Something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Ten or 12 minutes after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, I looked around for a little bit, you know, just observing
the people and things, and Officer Lewis turned them over to someone else,
as I recall, and sent them to the sheriff's office&mdash;to Mr. Decker's office. And
then it was either Lemmy Lewis or Buddy Walthers&mdash;(spelling) W-a-l-t-h-e-r-s,
one of our other criminal investigators, said that one of the bullets had ricocheted
off the south curb of Elm Street. So, Officer Lewis and I crossed&mdash;walked
down the hill and crossed Elm Street to look for the place where the
bullet might have hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say why he believed one of the bullets ricocheted off the
south curb of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; he just said that someone said that one of them had. So,
we checked it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So, you searched the south curb of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you find anything there to indicate the ricocheted bullet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; we didn't find anything at that time. Now, as we were
searching, we had just got over across the street, when I heard someone whistle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, about how many minutes was this after the time that you
had turned that young couple over to Lemmy Lewis that you heard this whistle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Fourteen or 15 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Fourteen or 15 minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this, you mean, after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. After the&mdash;from the time I heard the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>You heard someone whistle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes. So I turned and&mdash;uh&mdash;saw a man start to run down the
hill on the north side of Elm Street, running down toward Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And, about where was he with relation to the School Book Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Uh&mdash;directly across that little side street that runs in front of it.
He was on the south side of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And he was on the south side of what would be an extension
of Elm Street, if Elm Street didn't curve down into the underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right; right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where was he with relation to the west side of the School
Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right by the&mdash;uh&mdash;well, actually, directly in line with the west
corner&mdash;the southwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was directly in line with the southwest corner of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And he was on the south curve of that street that runs right
in front of the building there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And he started to run toward Elm Street as it curves under the
underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; directly down the grassy portion of the park.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>And then what did you see happen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I saw a light-colored station wagon, driving real slow, coming
west on Elm Street from Houston. Uh&mdash;actually, it was nearly in line with
him. And the driver was leaning to his right looking up the hill at the man
running down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. And the station wagon stopped almost directly across from me.
And&mdash;uh&mdash;the man continued down the hill and got in the station wagon.
And I attempted to cross the street. I wanted to talk to both of them. But
the&mdash;uh&mdash;traffic was so heavy I couldn't get across the street. And&mdash;uh&mdash;they
were gone before I <span class="locked">could&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did the station wagon head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. West on Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Under the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you describe the man that you saw running down toward
the station wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Oh, he was a white male in his twenties, five nine, five eight, something
like that; about 140 to 150; had kind of medium brown sandy hair&mdash;you
know, it was like it'd been blown&mdash;you know, he'd been in the wind or
something&mdash;it was all wild-looking; had on&mdash;uh&mdash;blue <span class="locked">trousers&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What shade of blue? Dark blue, medium or light?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; medium, probably; I'd say medium.</p>

<p>And, a&mdash;uh&mdash;light tan shirt, as I remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; nothing except that he looked like he was in an awful hurry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the man who was driving the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Now, he struck me, at first, as being a colored male. He was
very dark complected, had real dark short hair, and was wearing a thin
white-looking jacket&mdash;uh, it looked like the short windbreaker type, you know,
because it was real thin and had the collar that came out over the shoulder
(indicating with hands) like that&mdash;just a short jacket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say that he first struck you that way. Do you now think
that he was a Negro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, I don't&mdash;I didn't get a real good look at him. But my first
glance at him&mdash;I was more interested in the man coming down the hill&mdash;but
my first glance at him, he struck me as a Negro.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that what your opinion is today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, I&mdash;I couldn't say, because I didn't get a good enough look
at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind and what color station wagon was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It was light colored&mdash;almost&mdash;uh&mdash;it looked white to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What model or make was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I thought it was a Nash.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why would you think it was a Nash?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Because it had a built-in luggage rack on the top. And&mdash;uh&mdash;at
the time, this was the only type car I could fit with that type luggage rack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A Nash Rambler&mdash;is that what you're referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; with a rack on the the back portion of the car, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it have a Texas license plate, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It had the same color. I couldn't see the&mdash;uh&mdash;name with the
numbers on it. I could just barely make them out. They were at an angle
where I couldn't make the numbers of the&mdash;uh&mdash;any of the writing on it. But&mdash;uh&mdash;I'm
sure it was a Texas plate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about this incident that you can recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; not <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, then&mdash;uh, I went back up to the front of the School Book
Depository&mdash;rather, I went up to it and noticed that it was sealed off. There
was an officer standing guard in it with a shotgun in the doorway; several officers
crowded around in front of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long would this have been after the shots were fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I'd say nearly 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. And they were calling for hand lights to search the attic of the
building. At that time&mdash;uh&mdash;they thought the man was still in the building.
So, they were calling for hand lights to search the building.</p>

<p>So, I went back across to the sheriff's office and got some hand lights and
took them back over to them.</p>

<p>Then, I went up on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you go up on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, someone said that's where the shots came from. One of the
city officers, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. So, we went to the sixth floor where&mdash;uh&mdash;some empty cartridges
were found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the empty cartridges when they were found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I didn't see them when they were found. I saw them laying on
the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how soon after they were found did you see them laying on
the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Oh, a couple of minutes. I went right on over there. I was at
the far north end of the building. The cartridges were on the southeast
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, how did you know they had been found there? Did someone
yell&mdash;or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; someone yelled across the room that "here's the shells."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember who that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I couldn't recognize the voice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I went over there and&mdash;uh&mdash;didn't get too close because the
shells were laying on the ground and there was&mdash;uh&mdash;oh, a sack and a bunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
of things laying over there. So, you know, not to bother the area, I just went
back across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you say, there was a sack laying there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; I believe it was laying on top of a box, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How big a sack was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It was a paper bag (indicating with hands)&mdash;a small paper bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, the kind of paper bag that you carry your lunch in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yeah,&mdash;uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it more than a foot long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I don't know. I think it was rolled up kind of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You think it was rolled up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yeah; you know, kind of crushed up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any long sack laying in the floor there that you
remember seeing, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I don't remember seeing any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember seeing any thing there other than the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; not&mdash;uh&mdash;not anything that caught my eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you remember seeing the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. They were laying on the&mdash;uh&mdash;well, as you're facing the
<span class="locked">window&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you are facing the window and you're looking south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. The southeast corner window and you're looking south, the shells
would be on your right and back away from the window, as I recall, about a
foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you recall any of the shells right up against the wall at all&mdash;or,
don't you recall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I don't; I didn't look that close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shells did you see there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I saw three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone move any boxes in order to get in there&mdash;do you
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Now, that, I don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know if anyone moved any boxes in the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. That I don't know either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you look very closely at the area where the shells were
found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Uh&mdash;no, because the identification men hadn't arrived, and we
didn't want to stir up anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was there that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Oh, Officer Mooney with our department&mdash;Luke Mooney; Officer
Boone&mdash;Eugene Boone, with our department; myself; and some city officers
that I didn't know. Those are the only that I remember. You know, there
were several other people around but I didn't know them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. They wanted to search the building for the weapon, so I went
to the&mdash;I went to the northeast corner of the building and began to search west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Uh&mdash;everybody else took a different spot. And as I got nearly to
the west end of the building, Officer Boone&mdash;Eugene Boone with the sheriff's
office&mdash;hollered that here was the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far were you from Officer Boone when he hollered?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. About 8-foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I went over to the&mdash;uh&mdash;cluster of boxes where he was standing
and looked down between the boxes and saw the rifle lying on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say "between the cluster of boxes," could you describe
which way the boxes were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. There was a row going east to west on the north side of the
weapon, and a box going east to west on the south side of the weapon, and&mdash;uh&mdash;if
I remember, uh&mdash;as you'd look down, you had to look kinda back under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
the north stack of boxes to see the rifle. It was pushed kinda under&mdash;uh&mdash;or
up tight against 'em&mdash;you know, where it would be hard to see. And, of course,
both ends of the rows were closed off where you couldn't see through 'em. You
had to get up and look in 'em.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are gesturing with your hand there&mdash;would you say that
the boxes, then, as you gestured, were in the shape of what I would call a
rectangular "O", so to speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes, yes, uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And about how high were the walls of this enclosure, so to speak?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, it&mdash;it was different heights. Now, the part where I looked
in particularly was about&mdash;uh&mdash;oh, was about 5-foot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>And you gestured there in such a way that you had to lean over and look
straight down? Would that be a fair statement of your gestures?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; yes. You had to lean over the boxes and look down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what happened? After you found this, did people come over&mdash;or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; several other people came over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember about what time this was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I had no idea then how long it had been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Do you remember who else came over?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Oh, Officer Mooney and&mdash;uh&mdash;several of the city officers; Will
Fritz came over&mdash;Capt. Will Fritz, with the city of Dallas; some of his investigators,
I didn't know them; and a criminal identification man, I believe,
from the city of Dallas, then came over there to take pictures of the weapon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The weapon was moved by the time the pictures were taken?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; no. The pictures were taken as the weapon was found lying
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the pictures taken of the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know whether or not anything was moved in that
window before this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Anything else happen up to that time that you haven't related here that you
feel might be important?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No. Uh&mdash;I'm thinking it was about this time&mdash;uh&mdash;that we got
the news there had been a city officer shot over in Oak Cliff.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, there was just&mdash;uh&mdash;of course, everybody stayed there, you
know, and sort of mingled around and&mdash;uh&mdash;I then went back downstairs after
the weapon was picked up. The identification man from the city of Dallas
then, after he took his pictures, picked the weapon up and handed it to Will
Fritz.</p>

<p>And I then went back downstairs and over to the sheriff's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>At this time, do you know, did any person say that any employee in the
School Building was missing up until the time you left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I don't recall anybody saying anything to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had any description gone out for anyone that you know of with
regard to the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I think&mdash;uh&mdash;no description of the suspect in the shooting of the
officer hadn't went out at this time, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know of any other that went out at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Then you went back over to the Dallas Sheriff's Office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, I think I gave a statement to Rosemary Allen over there, as
did all the officers, as to what they were doing at the time, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. And&mdash;uh&mdash;then I kept thinking about this man that had run down
the hill and got in this car, so&mdash;uh&mdash;it was about, oh, I don't recall exactly the
time, nearly 5 or something like that, or after, when&mdash;uh&mdash;the city had apprehended
a suspect in the city officer's shooting. And&mdash;uh&mdash;information was
floating around that they were trying to connect him with the assassination of
the President&mdash;as the assassin.</p>

<p>So&mdash;uh, in the meantime, I kept thinking about this subject that had run and
got in the car. So, I called Captain Fritz' office and talked to one of his officers
and&mdash;uh&mdash;told him what I had saw and give him a description of the man,
asked him how it fit the man they had picked up as a suspect.</p>

<p>And&mdash;uh&mdash;it was then they asked me to come up and look at him at Captain
Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I drove up to Fritz' office about, oh, after 5&mdash;about 5:30 or something
like that&mdash;and&mdash;uh&mdash;talked to Captain Fritz and told him what I had
saw. And he took me in his office&mdash;I believe it was his office&mdash;it was a little
office, and had the suspect setting in a chair behind a desk&mdash;beside the desk.
And another gentleman, I didn't know him, he was sitting in another chair
to my left as I walked in the office.</p>

<p>And Captain Fritz asked me was this the man I saw&mdash;and I said, "Yes,"
it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Will you describe the man you saw in Captain Fritz' office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Oh, he was sitting down but&mdash;uh&mdash;he had the same medium brown
hair; it was still&mdash;well, it was kinda wild looking; he was slender, and&mdash;uh&mdash;what
I could tell of him sitting there, he was&mdash;uh&mdash;short. By that, I mean
not&mdash;myself, I'm five eleven&mdash;he was shorter than I was. And&mdash;uh&mdash;fairly
light build.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see his trousers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I couldn't see his trousers at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about his shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I believe, as close as I can remember, a T-shirt&mdash;a white T-shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>But you didn't see him in a lineup? You just saw him sitting there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; he was sitting there by himself in a chair&mdash;off to one side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Then, what did Captain Fritz say and what did you say and what did the
suspect say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Captain Fritz then asked him about the&mdash;uh&mdash;he said, "What
about this station wagon?"</p>

<p>And the suspect interrupted him and said, "That station wagon belongs to
Mrs. Paine"&mdash;I believe is what he said. "Don't try to tie her into this. She
had nothing to do with it."</p>

<p>And&mdash;uh&mdash;Captain Fritz then told him, as close as I can remember, that,
"All we're trying to do is find out what happened, and this man saw you leave
from the scene."</p>

<p>And the suspect again interrupted Captain Fritz and said, "I told you people
I did." And&mdash;uh&mdash;yeah&mdash;then, he said&mdash;then he continued and he said, "Everybody
will know who I am now."</p>

<p>And he was leaning over the desk. At this time, he had risen partially out
of the chair and leaning over the desk, looking directly at Captain Fritz.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was he wearing&mdash;or could you see the color of his trousers
as he leaned over the desk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; because he never&mdash;he just leaned up, you know, sort of forward&mdash;not
actually up, just out of his chair like that (indicating) forward.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then, did you say anything more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I then left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, in other words, the only thing you ever said was, "This
was the man,"&mdash;or words to that effect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Captain Fritz say anything more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I don't believe&mdash;not while I was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the suspect say anything more?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you say anything about that it was a Rambler station wagon
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. In the presence of the suspect?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know whether Captain Fritz said anything to the
suspect about this incident before you came, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can think of involving this interrogation
at which you were present?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No. Nothing else was said after that point. I then left and give
my name to the&mdash;uh&mdash;Secret Service agent and the FBI agent that was outside
the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else in connection with the assassination that you think
might be important that we haven't discussed here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; except&mdash;uh&mdash;except for the fact that it came out later that
Mrs. Paine does own a station wagon and&mdash;uh&mdash;it has a luggage rack on top.
And this came out, of course, later, after I got back to the office. I didn't know
about this. Buddy Walthers brought it up. I believe they went by the house
and the car was parked in the driveway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No. That's all. I forgot about it and went back to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, prior to the time we had your deposition taken, we chatted
for a few minutes about some of these things&mdash;is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For instance, we talked about your conversation with this young
couple&mdash;this Arnold Rowland and his wife?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything that we said before the deposition was taken
that we haven't recorded here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything that I said or you said in our conversation that
is different from anything that was recorded here&mdash;to the best of your recollection?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; except you asked me before, I believe, did I talk to any of the
railroad employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. And I said, "No"&mdash;which I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. (Pausing before reply.) No&mdash;nothing that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In our conversation, did you just relate to me what your story
was before we sat down to take the deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you agree to follow or to waive signing of the deposition
and leave it in the Court Reporter's hands&mdash;or do you want to sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It makes no difference to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, you had notice of this, did you not, of this taking of
this deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes. I have the letter right here in my pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Anything else you can think of, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we want to thank you for taking your time to come down
here and we appreciate your cooperation. We would appreciate your, also,
thanking Sheriff Decker for us, if you would, when you get back there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>One other thing before you go, Mr. Craig. We might have covered this
before, but I want to doublecheck it.</p>

When you talked to Mr. Rowland about what he saw in the window, did
he say whether or not two men he saw were white or colored?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; I determined that right away. I asked him whether they
were white or colored and he said white.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What else did he tell you about them? Did he tell you how much
of them he saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes. He said they&mdash;uh&mdash;walked back and forth in front of the
windows there&mdash;uh&mdash;several minutes. You know, not a long time but 3, 4, 5
minutes. He did state that one of them had a rifle with a scope on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he give you the color of the hair or the complexion or anything
like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No&mdash;no; this he couldn't give.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could he give you the type of clothing they were wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. If I recall, he was vague on one&mdash;he thought it was khakis, but
the other man he wasn't sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell you anything else about these people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; he said he looked up a few minutes later and&mdash;uh&mdash;there
was only one man up there then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever tell you anything about seeing any other people in
any other windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; he said there were people in other windows looking over
the ledges&mdash;you know, leaning up against the outside of the windows, looking
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell you whether any of these other people were on the
sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; these two men were the only ones he saw on that particular
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell you that was the sixth floor he saw them on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes. He said the second to the top floor&mdash;the next floor down;
which would be the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell you about ever seeing anyone else on the sixth floor&mdash;or
did he say that he didn't see anyone else on the sixth floor? Or don't you
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Just the two men. That's all he saw on that particular floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you specifically ask him if he saw anyone else on that floor,
or did he say that he did not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I asked him and he <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, what was your statement to him and what was his to
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. I asked him was there anybody else on the floor with these two
men. And he said, "No, just the two of them."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say that he saw these two men together first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then he just saw one, as I understand it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. A few minutes later, he looked back up there and saw just the
man with the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe he said earlier that he saw these men around 15 minutes
before the motorcade arrived? And then a few minutes later, you say that he
told you he saw only one man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he then tell you that he saw no men&mdash;or what did he say
about what he saw after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, then, I took him to Officer Lewis and turned him over to
Lemmy Lewis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of about that conversation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; there was not&mdash;I don't think there was anything else discussed
except for the fact that he told me he thought&mdash;he said he thought he
was a Secret Service agent&mdash;and that's why he didn't report it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, if you would just wait here one more minute, Mr. Craig, Mr. Ball stepped
in and he's going down to pick up some clothing. And we'd like to have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
take a look at this clothing and see if this looks familiar to any of the clothing
that you saw on the man running toward the Rambler.</p>

<p>If you'll just wait a minute here please sir.</p>

<p>(Mr. Ball returns to deposition room with box of clothing.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Craig, I hand you Exhibit No. 150. Have you ever seen a
shirt like this before? Does this look familiar to the shirt that the suspect
might have been wearing when you saw him, or this man running toward the
station wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. It's the same type of shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I believe you used the phrase, "light shirt". Would Exhibit 150
be darker than the shirt that he was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Uh&mdash;it looks darker in here&mdash;yes, uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this man running towards the station wagon wearing a
jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I don't believe he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I hand you Exhibit No. 156. Did the trousers that this man
running toward the station wagon had on&mdash;were they this color&mdash;lighter, darker,
or a different kind of trousers&mdash;or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No. They were&mdash;uh&mdash;they were work trousers like those; but
they looked blue to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And this Exhibit 156 looks kind of gray?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Exhibit 157?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, those are more the color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But they still looked different from Exhibit 157, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you discussed with Sheriff Decker the fact that when Oswald
was picked up they found a bus transfer in his pocket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. No; I knew&mdash;uh&mdash;nothing about a bus transfer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you feel, in your own mind, that the man you saw at Captain
Fritz's office was the same man that you saw running towards the station
wagon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Yes; I feel like it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you feel that you might have been influenced by the fact that
you knew he was the suspect&mdash;subconsciously, or do <span class="locked">you&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Craig</span>. Well, it's&mdash;it's possible, but I still feel strongly that it was the
same person.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay. That's it. Thank you.</p>

might say, of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the President's motorcade at all on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you standing with anyone there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. With James Romack. I and him had walked out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had walked out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I heard the siren; the parade was coming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You heard sirens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes, sir. And I had walked out in front of the place to where
I could get a better view, as a fellow says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Well, I had walked out in the truck lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the truck lot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And was <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. You might say would have been in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that have been in the middle of Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what direction were you facing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Facing south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, did you see the motorcade at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I didn't practically see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any sounds at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes. Heard the sounds of the parade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear the sounds that sounded like firecrackers or shots
at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Didn't hear that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far would you have been from the northeast corner of
the Texas School Book Depository when you were standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I would say right at a block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About a block. Do you have any idea about how many feet that
is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you just standing there, or were you walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I was just standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anything happen at all there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone in the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. The only thing&mdash;I told the guy, he was down there, the only
thing that I saw that looked suspicious to me, there was something like a
hundred pigeons flew up like you shot into them, and I noticed that, but I
never heard no shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you see them fly from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. From over the top of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which building? The School Book Depository or over on the
other side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. The Trinity Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which building did they fly off of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I wasn't looking. I just seen they all flew together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it look like they were flying up from both buildings?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Both buildings.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know about when this took place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time was it that you were looking that way, do you
remember, offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No; but it was just at the time that the parade was nearing
there, I know that.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had any of the parade already gone by the corner of Elm and
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you don't know whether it did or didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But would you say it was about that time that the motorcade was
to be going by there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. It was between 11 and 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was between 11 and 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. O'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What time did you&mdash;was this before or after you had lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Well, I just eat just any time I get a chance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know accurately what time it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could it have been as late as 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was before 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometime between 11 and 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Well, it was at the time that, really, that they had shot him,
because I was there when the policemen covered the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were there when the policemen covered the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With relation to the time that the policemen covered the place,
how many minutes before that did you see the birds fly up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I saw the pigeons there 2 or 3 minutes before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now after you saw the pigeons, you saw the police covering the
place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Within 2 or 3 minutes after you saw the pigeons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any people coming out the back door at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see the back door of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That was at the dock they have back there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you looking towards that direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how long did you keep your eyes fixed over there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Oh, I would say 5 minutes anyhow. Probably 10. I was
looking up that way at all times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Five or 10 minutes, you figure?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any people leave the Texas School Book Depository
by way of the rear exit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any people running north on Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you tell your company supervisor that there had been some
shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. No; not right then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Later did you tell them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes; I imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You said you stayed there 5 or 10 minutes looking to the south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Well, when the policemen began to crowd around and they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
over the place, well then I told him I thought that something had happened
over there.</p>

<p>I wasn't expecting anything like that until I just, of course, seen the policemen
all out there running back. They came out the back door and the side
door with guns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did you tell that to that you thought something happened
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Gail George.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that your foreman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you said you kept your eyes on this looking south for 5 or
10 minutes, what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Well, I went back to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Well, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. During this period of 5 or 10 minutes, did you walk close to the
building at all, or just stand there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Just stood out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Romack? Did he stand with you, or did he walk
closer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. He walked closer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of, whether I have asked it or not,
that in any way might be relevant to this inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. It wasn't a thing that I knew. I didn't really know or expect
what was taking place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Other than the pigeons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir, we thank you for your cooperation. You have a right, if you
want, to come back down and read your testimony and sign it, or you can
just waive doing that and have the court reporter send it directly to us without
your taking another trip down here. You can do it either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I can sign it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can either waive signing it or else you can come down again
and read it and sign it. By waiving, I mean you just let it go, assuming that
the court reporter will accurately transcribe it, or you have a right to come in
and read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. I will just let it go.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You waive signing it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rackley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is all for now.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. My name is David Belin. I am actually a practicing attorney from
Des Moines, Iowa. I have been with the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy for several months here, and we asked you to come

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old a man are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I am 39 years of age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you born in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go to school here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I went to school in Texas, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you get through school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I got a couple of years of college.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A couple of years of college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What college?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. East Texas State Teachers College and Technological College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to college right after high school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It was right after the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went right after the war?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you <span class="locked">go&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I take it back, I was going to Tech when the war broke out, and
went to East Texas State after the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When the war broke out, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I went into the Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do in the Navy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I was in the Amphibious, on the Aleutian Islands, and took boot
training in San Diego.</p>

<p>I went to the Aleutian Islands and came back and went to Pearl Harbor and
stayed out there for 9 months, and boarded an LST and went through the campaigns
of the Philippines and Okinawa and Japan and then returned back home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you get back to the States?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. March 1946.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I was stationed in Japan right after the last war. Where were
you stationed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I was on this LST in Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you in Japan after the war?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, I was there during the time the Treaty was signed. We
were in the, I forget the name, we were riding typhoons. We rode out eight of
them, and our ship came back without the two side doors. All we had was the
big ramp.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That must have been quite a voyage back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. They were taking water in the port and bailing it over in the
back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got back to the States, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Went to St. Louis and bought me an automobile, and just I was
a boy. I was the boy about 6 months, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Then I entered school, East Texas State Teachers College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went there about a year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Approximately a year, I would say, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I got married once along the route, and I was married about
30 days.</p>

<p>Then I came to Dallas in 1947. I guess it was 1947, or 1948, I forget just
when I did come to Dallas. It was along in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you have been in Dallas ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, were you honorably discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes; I surely was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I went to work with a motor freight carrier. They are known
as ICX today. They were Miller &amp; Miller Motor Freight at the time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Drove a truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Approximately a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Went back to East Texas, and my home, and piddled around for
a short while.</p>

<p>Then I came back to Dallas. And what did I do along in there? In 1949,
I went to work for the Cotton Belt Railroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Until April, I believe, of 1955. I know it was in 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you generally do when you were with the Cotton Belt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I did all the railroad work during that time. I mean, I have
been a billing clerk, and I have been a foreman, and I have been checker,
and assistant foreman, warehouse foreman, and I worked out in the yards, and
did quite a few jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You left them in 1955, and then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Went to work with&mdash;a friend wanted me to go to work with
him in a service station, Conoco Service Station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Stayed there a year, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Then I went to work with Strickland Transportation Co. as a
dock foreman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long were you with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Oh, I would say 6 or 7 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Then I went to work with an air freight concern out here at
Love Field Drive, driving a truck, delivering air freight and picking up air
freight for, I would say, 7 or 8 months there, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Then I hired out with the Coordinating Transportation Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Coordinated Transportation Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right, which that is where I am at today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What have you been doing for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Driving mostly your big van trailer-truck and bobtail trucks
and pickup and delivery service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you around the noon hour of November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I was on lunch period, just piddling around out north by east,
I would say, from the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were standing around Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It would be just about where Houston would intersect, but the
street was under construction at the time. They didn't have it, which they still
don't have it opened up for through traffic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you standing with anyone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, Lee and Mr. Rackley, we walked out there together originally
to start with. We were kind of piddling around, and I kind of walked
off ahead of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that George W. Rackley you were referring to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is he also known as "Pop" Rackley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You said you started walking away. Where did you walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Toward the School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Along what street did you walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, it wouldn't be no street at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, if there would be a street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I guess it would be just about, I don't know whether they are
going to split Ross and Houston Street up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you be looking at at Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. More or less. I would be looking at Houston Street; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, and what happened as you were walking?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I heard these three rifle shots sound out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you know they were rifle shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir; I did. I go elk hunting in Colorado every year in
October, and I just came back from this trip, and I am pretty familiar with a
rifle shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did they sound like they came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It sounded, I guess, like it came from that building, but it
wasn't on my side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it sound like it was up high or low?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I would say they were high. I have never been asked that
question, but it did sound like they were running out high, I would say, and
the wind was blowing a little bit from the south that day, I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The wind was blowing into your face as you walked, or was it
blowing from your back, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It was blowing into my face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Into your face.</p>

<p>How far were you from the School Book Depository Building when you
heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Oh, I probably was 125 yards. 100 to 125 yards, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that be from the nearest corner of the building or from
the front of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. From the nearest corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the northeast corner of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How close did the shots sound like they came together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Oh, they happened pretty fast. I would say maybe 3 or 4
seconds apart.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they equally spaced, or did one sound like it was closer
than another one in time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It sounded like to me that they were evenly spaced. They
rang out pretty fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever operated a bolt action rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you own one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it sound like the shots were faster than it could be operated
with a bolt action rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of rifle do you have now, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I have a&mdash;it is a&mdash;I can't answer that really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What caliber?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It is a 30-06.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 30-06 rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, it is. And it is an old World War I mechanism. It is
either an Enfleld or a Springfield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Bolt action?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You heard those rifle shots, and you think you could shoot your
rifle accurately as fast as you heard those shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I don't, wouldn't think that I would be that good a shot; no,
sir; because I shot at an elk four times and I hit him everywhere and missed
him one time out of four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. He was, I would say, 350 to 500 yards away. He was quite a
distance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Maybe I should have asked the question this way. Suppose he
was 100 yards away or else 50 yards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I would be more accurate with my shooting, I sure would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If he were, say, from 40 to 75 yards away, or not an elk, a person,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
do you think you could shoot 40 to 75 yards away accurately as quickly as
you heard those rifle sounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I wouldn't say I could; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you think an accurate rifleman could?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you heard the shots, and then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, I knew something was wrong. I mean, I could sense
that within my own self.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. And I looked up and I felt kind of chilly looking down towards
the&mdash;which I am facing the Houston entrance, and I looked down toward where
all the people were standing along, the motorcade was passing by, and just
immediately after I heard the shots, I saw a policeman running north towards
me. He was running to look to see if somebody was running out of the back
of this building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Texas School Book Depository Building. And he didn't stay
but just, oh, he was just there to check and he runs back.</p>

<p>Well, sensing that something is wrong, I automatically take over watching
the building for the man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What part of the building were you watching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. The back part.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see that back dock in the back part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, I mean, they got it sealed off. I could see as much as
anyone could see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you see&mdash;there are some stairs that go up to the back dock,
aren't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to a first floor plan of the Texas School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you watch those stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you watch them after you saw the policeman
leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, I watched them all the time until someone arrived, and
the only time I did take my back off, turn my back to the building was Sam
Pate with his KBOX news, he arrived before any of the police or anyone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that KBOX?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that a radio or television station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It is a radio station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you take your eyes off then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. He was driving up and they were having a little high&mdash;the
city has a piece of wood that they use to stop traffic coming through, and I'd
taken that so he could come through, drive his truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you leave your post?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I didn't leave. That was right there, even closer than what
we were. But all I did was let that down for him, and then <span class="locked">we&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that have taken less than a minute?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Less than 30 seconds, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay after that watching that back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, we were all there watching it then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long a period of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see a policeman go up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I saw policemen up in there. I didn't see anyone come up
the back. They came in the front, all&mdash;most of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any employees walk up the back way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. There was two other gentlemen which I never said anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
about, that taken over. They were FBI or something standing right here at
the very entrance, and just stood there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing again to the back stairway that leads up from
the street to the dock on the north side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. See anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. No, sir; other than all the motorcycle officers and squad cars.
They started coming in, I would say, in 4 minutes from the time that this
happened. They were swarming the building, which naturally I quit watching
anything particular.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, about 4 minutes after the shots came you quit
watching it? Would that be accurate, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, I would say somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 minutes,
4 or 5 minutes. That would probably be true. I stayed there, but I
wasn't particularly watching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, then as I understand your testimony, you said
that from about the time of the shots until about 5 minutes after the shots, you
watched the back door of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not you saw anyone leave the
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. They wasn't anyone left the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not you saw anyone enter the
building other than a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. No one entered while I was standing there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anybody running down the street near you at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you standing? How far were you from this stairway
going to this Houston Street dock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, after this KBOX&mdash;you are asking prior to before he
got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before KBOX got there first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I would say I moved between 75 yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. 75 yards of the northeast corner of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. 75 yards of the northeast corner of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After KBOX got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. He got to about, I would say, maybe 35 yards to the building,
or 40. That is where he parked his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did he stay, KBOX?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Oh. I would say 35 or 40 minutes. Then I went and called
my wife and was telling her the sad news, and then I went back and stayed
again. I ended up laying off work. I didn't even work that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever contact the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It was on a Saturday night after I got in from work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What month was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It was this past month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean March?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What caused you to contact the FBI in March?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I was trying to pinpoint the day that I must have come in from
work. It was on the weekend that I'd come home, and there was a paper up
in the left-hand corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Dallas newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which one, do you know, offhand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Herald, the paper that I take.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I saw an article that was written by a guy, which I have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
concerned about this thing all the way through, the assassination and I got
to reading it, and it is a story that just don't jibe with about me sitting there
and watching the building. It just kind of upset me to know there is some
monkey just hatched up such a story.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the story that you read that you got concerned about?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. About a guy seeing a rifle drawn in from the building above
him, and he also seen the people as the shots were being fired, and he also seen
some character running toward me with an overcoat on which was brown or
gray or blue, and he heard 4 shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Do you remember what page of the paper
this was on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It was on the headlines. I don't mean the headlines. It was on
the front page in the left corner of the page.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you say something concerned you about the article. Was it
the fact that he said he saw a rifle there that concerned you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. No, sir; the fact that he was running somebody over me, and
that is what I was out there doing. That is what I was doing. I was watching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the portion of the article that concerned you was that
someone said that someone else was running?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Towards Pacific Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Towards Pacific Street from the direction of the School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. That is the way the article read, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you tell the FBI when you called them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I told them, tried to tell them about the same thing that I am
telling you right now today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have I ever mentioned before, by the way, or talked to you before
this morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the fact as to whether or not as soon as we met, you
came in here and we started taking your deposition immediately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right. Unless you called me last Saturday. I don't remember
who called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, on Saturday, what did someone do, call you and tell you to
come down here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did that person talk to you about the facts that we were talking
about now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It wasn't I, just for the record. I believe it was the Secret Service
that called you, but I am not sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. It was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I understand your testimony correctly, what you are stating
is that you don't believe anyone ran out of the building towards you, at
least within the first 5 minutes after the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't think anyone went out of the building during the first
5 minutes after the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. That is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else, any other information you have that you
feel might be helpful to the investigation of the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I can't think of anything, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we want to thank you very much for taking the time to
come down here. We appreciate your cooperation, and certainly your cooperation
particularly in volunteering to call the FBI to contact them for this
information.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Well, I felt that&mdash;I called an attorney that I know and talked to
him about the deal before I called the FBI, and I told him I wasn't doing this
for a publicity thing. It was something I just didn't, after reading that article,
it kind of upset me, and he said he felt it was my duty to call the FBI and
let them know.</p>

<p>And that is when I went ahead and made my statement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mr. Romack, you have the right, if you want, to come back
down here after these notes of the court reporter are typed, to read the typewritten
transcript and sign it, or you can waive reading it and signing it and
just have her send it directly to Washington, whatever you want to do. It
makes no difference with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. I will waive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You want to waive it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Again we want to thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Romack</span>. You are quite welcome.</p>

<h2 id="t284"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_LEE_E_BOWERS_JR" id="TESTIMONY_OF_LEE_E_BOWERS_JR">TESTIMONY OF LEE E. BOWERS, JR.</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Lee E. Bowers, Jr. was taken at 2 p.m., on April 2, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you stand and be sworn, Mr. Bowers?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give for this
Commission will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Lee E. Bowers, Jr.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your residence address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. 10508 Maplegrove Lane.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And would you tell me something about yourself, where you were
born, raised, and what has been your business, generally, or occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. I was born right here in Dallas, and lived here most of my life
except when I was in the Navy, at the age of 17 to 21, and I was away 2
years going to Hardin Simmons University, also, attended Southern Methodist
University 2 years, majoring in religion. I worked for the railroad 15 years and
was a self-employed builder, as well as&mdash;on the side. And the first of this
year when I went to work as business manager for Dr. Tim Green who operates
this hospital and convalescent home and rent properties.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What railroad did you work for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Worked for the Union Terminal Co. with the 8 participating
railroads.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And on November 22, 1963, were you working for the Union
Terminal Co.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work were you doing for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. I was tower man in the north tower, Union Terminal, operating
the switches and signals controlling the movement of trains.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Through railroad yards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were your hours of work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. 7 to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you remember what is the height of&mdash;above the ground
at which you worked in the tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. It is second story, it is 14 feet, 12 or 14 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You worked about 14 feet above the ground?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the tower was arranged so that you could see out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; it is windows except for posts that&mdash;posts on each corner.
It is windows on all four sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is that located with reference to the corner of Elm and
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. It is west and north of this corner, and as to distances, I
really don't know. It is within 50 yards of the back of the School Depository
Building, or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say that it is built on higher ground, the base of the
tower on higher ground than around Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Approximately the same.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Same? It is higher ground than Elm as it recedes down under
the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes, sir; considerably.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the base of your tower is about the same height as the triple
underpass, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, can you tell me why you refer to that as a triple underpass?
In our conversation here before you were sworn your description&mdash;you described
it as a triple underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. It is just a local connotation for it since there are three streets
that run under it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. And how many sets of tracks do you control from your
tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. There are about 11 tracks in the station and 2 freight tracks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be 13 tracks that is, the tracks altogether, that pass
in front of your tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; of course where the tracks converge and cross and split
off to various railroad <span class="locked">yards&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the tracks are to the north and west of your tower, aren't
they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Well, the tracks are west, but they proceed in all directions, I
mean, they are both north and south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you were on duty on November 22, 1963, weren't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Close to noon, did you make any observation of the area around
between your tower and Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; because of the fact that the area had been covered by
police for some 2 hours. Since approximately 10 o'clock in the morning traffic
had been cut off into the area so that anyone moving around could actually be
observed. Since I had worked there for a number of years I was familiar with
most of the people who came in and out of the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice any cars around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; there were three cars that came in during the time from
around noon until the time of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Came in where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. They came into the vicinity of the tower, which was at the
extension of Elm Street, which runs in front of the School Depository, and
which there is no way out. It is not a through street to anywhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is parking area behind the School Depository, between that
building and your tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Two or three railroad tracks and a small amount of parking
area for the employees.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the first came along that you noticed about what time of day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. I do not recall the exact time, but I believe this was approximately
12:10, wouldn't be too far off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the car you noticed, when you noticed the car, where was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. The car proceeded in front of the School Depository down across
2 or 3 tracks and circled the area in front of the tower, and to the west of the
tower, and, as if he was searching for a way out, or was checking the area, and
then proceeded back through the only way he could, the same outlet he came into.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The place where Elm dead ends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. That's right. Back in front of the School Depository was the
only way he could get out. And I lost sight of him, I couldn't watch him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the description of that car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. The first car was a 1959 Oldsmobile, blue and white station
wagon with out-of-State license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what State?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. No; I do not. I would know it, I could identify it, I think,
if I looked at a list.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And, it had something else, some bumper stickers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Had a bumper sticker, one of which was a Goldwater sticker,
and the other of which was of some scenic location, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And, did you see another car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes, some 15 minutes or so after this, at approximately 12
o'clock, 20 to 12&mdash;I guess 12:20 would be close to it, little time differential there&mdash;but
there was another car which was a 1957 black Ford, with one male in it
that seemed to have a mike or telephone or something that gave the appearance
of that at least.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How could you tell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. He was holding something up to his mouth with one hand and
he was driving with the other, and gave that appearance. He was very close
to the tower. I could see him as he proceeded around the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of license did that have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Had a Texas license.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did it do as it came into the area, from what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Came in from the extension of Elm Street in front of the School
Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see it leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; after 3 or 4 minutes cruising around the area it departed
the same way. He did probe a little further into the area than the first car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see another car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Third car, which entered the area, which was some seven or
nine minutes before the shooting, I believe was a 1961 or 1962 Chevrolet, four-door
Impala, white, showed signs of being on the road. It was muddy up to
the windows, bore a similar out-of-state license to the first car I observed,
occupied also by one white male.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did it do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. He spent a little more time in the area. He tried&mdash;he circled
the area and probed one spot right at the tower in an attempt to get and was
forced to back out some considerable distance, and slowly cruised down back
towards the front of the School Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then did he leave?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. The last I saw of him he was pausing just about in&mdash;just above
the assassination site.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the car park, or continue on or did you notice?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Whether it continued on at that very moment or whether it
pulled up only a short distance, I couldn't tell. I was busy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long was this before the President's car passed there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. This last car? About 8 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you in a position where you could see the corner of Elm
and Houston from the tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. No; I could not see the corner of Elm and Houston. I could
see the corner of Main and Houston as they came down and turned on, then
I couldn't see it for about half a block, and after they passed the corner of
Elm and Houston the car came in sight again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw the President's car coming out the Houston Street from
Main, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; I saw that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you lost sight of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Right. For a moment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you saw it again where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. It came in sight after it had turned the corner of Elm and
Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anything?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. I heard three shots. One, then a slight pause, then two very
close together. Also reverberation from the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you able to form an opinion as to the source of the
sound or what direction it came from, I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. The sounds came either from up against the School Depository
Building or near the mouth of the triple underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you able to tell which?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. No; I could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, now, had you had any experience before being in the tower
as to sounds coming from those various places?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; I had worked this same tower for some 10 or 12 years,
and was there during the time they were renovating the School Depository
Building, and had noticed at that time the similarity of sounds occurring in
either of those two locations.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me now whether or not it came, the sounds you
heard, the three shots came from the direction of the Depository Building or
the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. No; I could not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From your experience there, previous experience there in hearing
sounds that originated at the Texas School Book Depository Building, did you
notice that sometimes those sounds seem to come from the triple underpass?
Is that what you told me a moment ago?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. There is a similarity of sound, because there is a reverberation
which takes place from either location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you heard sounds originating near the triple underpass before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; quite often.</p>

<p>Because trucks backfire and various occurrences.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you had heard noises originating from the Texas School
Depository when they were building there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. They were renovating. I&mdash;did carpenter work as well as sandblasted
the outside of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, were there any people standing on the high side&mdash;high ground
between your tower and where Elm Street goes down under the underpass
toward the mouth of the underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Directly in line, towards the mouth of the underpass, there were
two men. One man, middle-aged, or slightly older, fairly heavy-set, in a
white shirt, fairly dark trousers. Another younger man, about midtwenties,
in either a plaid shirt or plaid coat or jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they standing together or standing separately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. They were standing within 10 or 15 feet of each other, and
gave no appearance of being together, as far as I knew.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In what direction were they facing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. They were facing and looking up towards Main and Houston, and
following the caravan as it came down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anyone standing on the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. On the triple underpass, there were two policemen. One facing
each direction, both east and west. There was one railroad employee, a signal
man there with the Union Terminal Co., and two welders that worked for the
Fort Worth Welding firm, and there was also a laborer's assistant furnished
by the railroad to these welders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw those before the President came by, you saw those people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; they were there before and after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were they standing on the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; they were standing on top of it facing towards Houston
Street, all except, of course, the one policeman on the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any other people up on this high ground?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. There were one or two people in the area. Not in this same
vicinity. One of them was a parking lot attendant that operates a parking
lot there. One or two. Each had uniforms similar to those custodians at the
courthouse. But they were some distance back, just a slight distance back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you heard the sound, which way were you looking?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. At the moment I heard the sound, I was looking directly towards
the area&mdash;at the moment of the first shot, as close as my recollection serves,
the car was out of sight behind this decorative masonry wall in the area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when you heard the second and third shot, could you see the
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. No; at the moment of the shots, I could&mdash;I do not think that it
was in sight. It came in sight immediately following the last shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any activity in this high ground above Elm after
the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. At the time of the shooting there seemed to be some commotion,
and immediately following there was a motorcycle policeman who shot
nearly all of the way to the top of the incline.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On his motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he come by way of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. He was part of the motorcade and had left it for some reason,
which I did not know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He came <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. He came almost to the top and I believe abandoned his motorcycle
for a moment and then got on it and proceeded, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did he get up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. He just shot up over the curb and up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't come then by way of Elm, which dead ends there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. No; he left the motorcade and came up the incline on the
motorcycle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was his motorcycle directed toward any particular people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. He came up into this area where there are some trees, and where
I had described the two men were in the general vicinity of this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were the two men there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. I&mdash;as far as I know, one of them was. The other I could not
say.</p>

<p>The darker dressed man was too hard to distinguish from the trees. The
one in the white shirt, yes; I think he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you said there was a commotion, what do you mean by
that? What did it look like to you when you were looking at the commotion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. I just am unable to describe rather than it was something out of
the ordinary, a sort of milling around, but something occurred in this particular
spot which was out of the ordinary, which attracted my eye for some reason,
which I could not identify.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You couldn't describe it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Nothing that I could pinpoint as having happened <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Afterwards did a good many people come up there on this high
ground at the tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. A large number of people came, more than one direction. One
group converged from the corner of Elm and Houston, and came down the extension
of Elm and came into the high ground, and another line&mdash;another large
group went across the triangular area between Houston and Elm and then
across Elm and then up the incline. Some of them all the way up.</p>

<p>Many of them did, as well as, of course, between 50 and a hundred policemen
within a maximum of 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In this area around your tower?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. That's right. Sealed off the area, and I held off the trains until
they could be examined, and there was some transients taken on at least one
train.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I believe you have talked this over with me before your deposition
was taken, haven't we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there anything that you told me that I haven't asked you about
that you think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Nothing that I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have told me all that you know about this, haven't you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Yes; I believe that I have related everything which I have told
the city police, and also told to the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And everything you told me before we started taking the
deposition?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. To my knowledge I can remember nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this will be reduced to writing, and you can sign it, look it
over and sign it, or waive your signature if you wish.</p>

<p>What do you wish?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. I have no reason to sign it unless you want me to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you just as leave waive the signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bowers</span>. Fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then we thank you very much.</p>

<h2 id="t289"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_B_J_Martin" id="TESTIMONY_OF_B_J_Martin">TESTIMONY OF B.&nbsp;J. MARTIN</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of B.&nbsp;J. Martin was taken at 10:10 a.m., on April 3, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you stand up, please, and be sworn?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before this
Commission shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state you name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. B.&nbsp;J. Martin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your residence address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. 11830 Flamingo Lane, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I am a police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been with the Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It will be 11 years in June.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me something about yourself, when you were born and where
you were raised and where you went to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I was born in Maud, Okla., Seminole County&mdash;went to school&mdash;high
school at Maud, Okla., and entered the Navy in 1948, from there and was
discharged in 1952 and lived at Compton, Okla., for approximately a year, and
then returned to Dallas and was employed in the Police Department in June 1953.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you employed as a motorcycle officer at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir; I was employed as an apprentice policeman and worked
in the radio patrol division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are not a motorcycleman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been a motorcycle officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Let's see, 8 years in January.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, did you have some special assignment?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; I was assigned to the motorcade of President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you went out to Love Field, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; we made detail about 7 o'clock that morning and was
assigned, I don't recall now just what time&mdash;it was about 30 minutes before his
plane was to arrive at Love Field.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in the motorcade what was your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I was assigned to ride on the left-hand rear side of President
Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you riding alone there, or was another officer riding
with you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There was another officer riding with me, B.&nbsp;W. Hargis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was parallel to you on another motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; we <span class="locked">were&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Two motorcycles abreast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you turned onto Houston from Main, can you tell me about the
speed of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. My estimation would be 4 to 5 miles an hour when we made the
turn onto Elm Street from Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you make the turn from Main to Houston about the same
speed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir; we were going a little faster, I would say&mdash;between
probably 10 and 15 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then the block between Main and Elm, did the motorcade
slow down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It slowed down just before we made the turn onto Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's take the President's car&mdash;what do you think the speed of the
President's car was as you made that turn from Houston onto Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe the speed was about 4 or 5 miles an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your speed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Approximately the same&mdash;maybe a mile slower.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you able to maintain your position on the two-wheeler motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the minimum speed at which you can maintain the position
of that motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. About 2 miles per hour, I would imagine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the President's car pick up any speed from the corner of
Houston and Elm&mdash;we'll say half way down that hill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir; I don't recall it picking up any speed in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were going fairly slow?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It may have picked up, gradually picked up, but not enough that
I could notice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear any unusual noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; I heard a shot, or what I thought at the time to be a
shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the position of your motorcycle at that time with reference
to the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Just to the rear of his car&mdash;on the left rear of his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far from the car, I'll say, to the left of the car and then how
far to the rear&mdash;so I can get some idea of your position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I would say that my motor was 5-foot to the left and approximately
6- to 8-foot to the rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Of the President's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you anywhere near the front end of the Secret Service car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The car the Secret Service men were in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; we were alongside the front end of their car, because one
of the agents got off of the car after the first shot. The best I can remember&mdash;I
was fairly close to him&mdash;he was the person riding on the fender of the car and
the first agent from the front of the car, and I was fairly close to him when he
jumped off of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, where was the motorcycle driven by Mr. Hargis, with reference
to your right or to your left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. He was to my right when we made the turn on Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the time you heard this shot, where was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I presume he was still to my right. I don't recall seeing him
after the shots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He would have been closer to the President's car than you would
have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;he would have been&mdash;I would say 3- or 4-foot closer
than I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You traveled along the street about 3 or 4 feet apart from each
other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you heard the first shot, did you have any idea of the direction
which the shot was coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir; I didn't. I couldn't tell from which direction it was
coming&mdash;any of the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; I looked back to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After which shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. After the first shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You looked to your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I looked back to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you look at?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. At the building on the right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As you turned to the right, did you turn your motorcycle also, or
did you turn your body?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe I just turned my body. I don't believe I ever turned
my motor. I believe I kept my motor headed down Elm Street&mdash;west on
Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take any notice of the President after the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; I looked at the President after I heard the shot and he
was leaning forward&mdash;I could see the left side of his face. At the time he had
no expression on his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, did you hear some more shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Two more shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything when you looked at the School Depository
Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir&mdash;just the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you able to tell&mdash;to determine or did you have any
opinion, as to the direction from which the shots were coming&mdash;the last two
shots&mdash;from which direction they came?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir; you couldn't tell just where they were coming from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any breeze that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I believe it was blowing out of the southwest at that particular
location. It seemed like we were going to turn into the wind as we turned off of
Houston onto Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The wind was in your face?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; the best I can recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, afterward, did the motorcade pick up speed then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. After we turned onto Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; after the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes&mdash;after the shots we picked up speed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go on to Parkland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; I did. I rode just part of the time alongside of the
President's car. At times we were forced to the rear because of the pedestrians
standing out on Stemmons and there just wasn't enough room to ride in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see the President?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir; I couldn't see him&mdash;immediately after the first shot I
saw him and after that I couldn't see him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you see the Governor at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir. I didn't pay any attention to the Governor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you got to Parkland Hospital, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. We pulled into the emergency entrance to Parkland Hospital.
The traffic had already begun to stack up and the officers ahead of the
motorcade went on down into the exit and I stopped off at the first turn into
the exit about 50 or 60 yards from the entrance to the emergency and began
to cut traffic so they wouldn't block the roadway down into the emergency
and then we had to park cars&mdash;just a lot of people got out of their cars and
it was all blocked up and we had to park cars and just generally work traffic
around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You had a white helmet on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you notice any stains on your helmet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; during the process of working traffic there, I noticed
that there were blood stains on the windshield on my motor and then I pulled
off my helmet and I noticed there were blood stains on the left side of my
helmet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To give a more accurate description of the left side, could you tell
us about where it started with reference to the forehead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was just to the left&mdash;of what would be the center of my
forehead&mdash;approximately halfway, about a quarter of the helmet had spots of
blood on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were there any other spots of any other material on the
helmet there besides blood?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir; there was other matter that looked like pieces of
flesh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about your uniform?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There was blood and matter on my left shoulder of my uniform.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You pointed to a place in front of your shoulder, about the
clavicle region?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that about where it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the front of your uniform and not on the side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be left, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes; on the left side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And just below the level of the shoulder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what spots were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. They were blood spots and other matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you notice on your windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. There was blood and other matter on my windshield and also on
the motor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the blood noticeable&mdash;were there large splotches?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No; they weren't large splotches, they were small&mdash;it was not
very noticeable unless you looked at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the discoloration on your helmet noticeable?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Not too much&mdash;no&mdash;as a matter of fact, there were other people
around there and two more officers there and they never noticed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At that time were you with Mr. Hargis?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir; I don't believe that he went to the hospital with us.
I believe he stopped there at the scene of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you ever see his helmet or his uniform or the windshield
of his motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir&mdash;I never recall seeing him again until the next day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, was this blood on the outside or the inside of your windshield?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was on the outside of my windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it on the right or left side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was on the outside of my windshield.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what about the fender of the motorcycle?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It was just in the front&mdash;right on the front just above the cowling
on the motorcycle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say that when you first heard the first shot you thought it
was rifle fire?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;the sharp crack of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you familiar with guns?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever fire a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you own a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have been hunting, I suppose?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I just returned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You've shot high-powered rifles, have you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what do you think the speed of the President's car was&mdash;give
me your best estimate of the speed of the President's car when you heard
the first shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. I would say it was under 10 miles an hour&mdash;between 5 and 10
at that particular time, about the time of the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were going downhill at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir. The best I remember&mdash;I wasn't having any trouble
keeping my motor up at that time, so that it was probably between 5 and 10
miles an hour. I don't think it was any faster than 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you at any time come abreast of the President's car in the
motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you under certain instructions as to how far behind the car
you were to keep?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were those instructions?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. They instructed us that they didn't want anyone riding past the
President's car and that we were to ride to the rear, to the rear of his car,
about the rear bumper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all, Officer.</p>

<p>This will be written up and you can look it over and sign it if you wish,
or you can waive your signature and we will send it on to the Commission
without it.</p>

<p>It's your option.</p>

<p>What would you like to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. It doesn't make any difference&mdash;it's the truth as I saw it that
day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You just as soon waive your signature, then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. That would be fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, we'll waive your signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thanks very much for coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Martin</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>The testimony of Bobby W. Hargis was taken at 3:20 p.m., on April 8, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Will you stand, please.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you are about to give shall be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. I do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Would you state for the record your name and residence address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Bobby W. Hargis, 1818 Adelaide, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How long have you been a member of the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Nine years and about 7 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you are now a member of the <span class="locked">motorcycle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Division.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Division?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Were you a part of the motorcade on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes; I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. In what position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. I was at the left-hand side of the Presidential limousine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. At what part of the President's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Front, or rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Oh. Rear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Riding next to Mrs. Kennedy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Will you describe what occurred or what you observed as the
limousine turned into Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Well, at the time that the limousine turned left on Elm Street
I was staying pretty well right up with the car. Sometimes on Elm we couldn't
get right up next to it on account of the crowd, but the crowd was thinning
out down here at the triple underpass, so, I was next to Mrs. Kennedy when I
heard the first shot, and at that time the President bent over, and Governor
Connally turned around. He was sitting directly in front of him, and a real
shocked and surprised expression on his face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. On Governor Connally's?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes; that is why I thought Governor Connally had been shot
first, but it looked like the President was bending over to hear what he had
to say, and I thought to myself then that Governor Connally, the Governor
had been hit, and then as the President raised back up like that (indicating)
the shot that killed him hit him. I don't know whether it was the second or
the third shot. Everything happened so fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. But, you cannot now recall more than two shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. That is all that I can recall remembering. Of course, everything
was moving so fast at the time that there could have been 30 more shots that
I probably never would have noticed them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did something happen to you, personally in connection with the
shot you have just described?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. You mean about the blood hitting me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes; when President Kennedy straightened back up in the car
the bullet him in the head, the one that killed him and it seemed like his
head exploded, and I was splattered with blood and brain, and kind of a
bloody water. It wasn't really blood. And at that time the Presidential car
slowed down. I heard somebody say, "Get going," or "get <span class="locked">going,"&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Someone <span class="locked">inside&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. I don't know whether it was the Secret Service car, and I remembered
seeing Officer Chaney. Chaney put his motor in first gear and accelerated
up to the front to tell them to get everything out of the way, that he was coming
through, and that is when the Presidential limousine shot off, and I stopped
and got off my motorcycle and ran to the right-hand side of the street, behind
the light pole.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Just a minute. Do you recall your impression at the time regarding
the source of the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Well, at the time it sounded like the shots were right next to me.
There wasn't any way in the world I could tell where they were coming from,
but at the time there was something in my head that said that they probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
could have been coming from the railroad overpass, because I thought since
I had got splattered, with blood&mdash;I was just a little back and left of&mdash;just a
little bit back and left of Mrs. Kennedy, but I didn't know. I had a feeling
that it might have been from the Texas Book Depository, and these two places
was the primary place that could have been shot from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. You were clear that the sounds were sounds of shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes, sir; I knew they were shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. All right, what did you do then? You say you parked your motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes, <span class="locked">uh-huh&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. It was to the left-hand side of the street from&mdash;south side of Elm
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. I ran across the street looking over towards the railroad overpass
and I remembered seeing people scattering and running and then I
<span class="locked">looked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. People on the overpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes; people that were there to see the President I guess. They
were taking pictures and things. It was kind of a confused crowd. I don't
know whether they were trying to hide or see what was happening or what&mdash;and
then I looked over to the Texas School Book Depository Building, and no
one that was standing at the base of the building was&mdash;seemed to be looking up
at the building or anything like they knew where the shots were coming
from, <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. How about the people on the incline on the north side of Elm
Street? Do you recall their behavior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes; I remember a man holding a child. Fell to the ground and
covered his child with his body, and people running everywhere, trying to
get out of there, I guess, and they were about as confused as to where the
shots were coming from as everyone else was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And did you run up the incline on your side of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes, sir; I ran to the light post, and I ran up to this kind of a
little wall, brick wall up there to see if I could get a better look on the bridge,
and, of course, I was looking all around that place by that time. I knew it
couldn't have come from the county courthouse because that place was swarming
with deputy sheriffs over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you get behind the picket fence that runs from the overpass
to the concrete wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. On the north side of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. No, no; I don't remember any picket fence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Did you observe anything then on the overpass, or on the incline,
or around the Depository? Anything out of the ordinary besides people
running?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. No; I didn't. That is what got me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. So, at that point you were still uncertain as to the direction of
the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes, uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Well, then, I thought since I had looked over at the Texas
Book Depository and some people looking out of the windows up there, didn't
seem like they knew what was going on, but none of them were looking towards,
or near anywhere the shots had been fired from. At the time I didn't know,
but about the only activity I could see was on the bridge, on the railroad
bridge <span class="locked">so&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. What sort of activity was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Well, the people that were up there were just trying to get a
better look at what was happening and was in a haze and running, or in a confused
fashion, and I thought maybe some of them had seen who did the shooting
and the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Then I got back on my motorcycle, which was still running,
and rode underneath the first underpass to look on the opposite side in order
to see if I could see anyone running away from the scene, and since I didn't
see anyone coming from that direction I rode under the second underpass,
which is Stemmons Expressway and went up around to see if I could see
anyone coming from across Stemmons and back that way, and I couldn't
see anything that was of a suspicious nature, so, I came back to the Texas
School Book Depository. At that time it seemed like the activity was centered
around the Texas School Book Depository, so, that is when I heard
someone say, one of the sergeants or lieutenants, I don't know, "Don't let anyone
out of the Texas School Book Depository," and so, I went to a gap that
had not been filled, which was at the southwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. And you remained there until you were relieved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Anything else that you haven't told us that you think is relevant
to our inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. No; I don't believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Thank you very much, Mr. Hargis.</p>

<p>The reporter will transcribe your testimony and have it available for you
to read and sign if you care to. Otherwise, you may waive your right to
review and sign the testimony and she will mail it direct to the Commission,
whichever you prefer. It is entirely your option.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Well; it really doesn't make any difference. It is more or
less what you all think is best.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. It's entirely up to you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. Well, how long will it be until she fixes it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. Well, off the record.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Stern</span>. On the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Hargis</span>. All right. Well, just go ahead and I will just let you go ahead
and send it in without the signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got out of the Air Force?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Went to work for the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What year was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. 1955.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been with them ever since?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Other than 11 months in which I left the department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do in that 11 months?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Went into a business of my own.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then went back to the department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was your assignment that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Solo motorcycle officer on escort of the Presidential motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You started with the motorcade at Love Field?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Went through town with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you riding as you went through town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Riding to the right rear of the Presidential car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many cars back, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Well, it varied. It would be hard to say as to how many
cars back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether Officer M.&nbsp;L. Baker was riding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. He was riding in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you would be riding several cars back, generally, from the
President's car, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any shots at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I was on Main Street just approaching Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were the three spaced equally distant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Go ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was one more close than the other one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. The last two were closer than the first. In other words, it
was the first, and then a pause, and then the other two were real close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after you heard the sounds?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I made the shift down to lower gear and went on to the
scene of the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean by the scene of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. There on Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I am sorry, on Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What position of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Be just west of Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the scene of the shooting, do you mean the place where you
believed the President's car was when the bullets struck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. When I first got to the location there, I was still on Houston<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
Street, and in the process of making a left turn onto Elm Street I could see
all these people laying on the ground there on Elm. Some of them were pointing
back up to the railroad yard, and a couple of people were headed back up that
way, and I immediately tried to jump the north curb there in the 400 block,
which was too high for me to get over.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean with your motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. And I left my motor on the street and ran to the railroad yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you ran to the railroad yard, would that be north or
south of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. The railroad yard would be located at the&mdash;it consist of going
over Elm Street and back north of Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Well, there was nothing. There was quite a few people in the
area, spectators, and at that time I went back to my motorcycle&mdash;it was on the
street&mdash;to the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any people running away from there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No. They was all going to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to any people over there or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. In the railroad yard, I talked to one of the people I presumed to
be a railroad detective that was in the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had he been in the yard before or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No. He was just coming into the area after I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was coming into the area after the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything to you, that you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Nothing that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I went back to my motorcycle, which was sitting on Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. At that time some people came up and started talking to me
as to the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did they say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. One stated that he had seen the President when the first
shot was fired, and that he definitely was hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say where the shot came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. And I asked him about where the shots came from, and he
stated that he didn't know, that he was looking at him when the first shot was
fired, and that he slumped. And when the second shot was fired, he went completely
out of sight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You talked to any other witnesses there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes. There was another one came up who was located, at
the time he stated, on the south side of Elm Street back toward the triple
underpass. Back, well, it would be north of the underpass there, and said he
had gotten hit by a piece of concrete or something, and he did have a slight
cut on his right cheek, upper portion of his cheek just to the right of his nose.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would he have been to the front or to the back of the Presidential
car at the time of the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I don't know what you mean to the front or the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he was standing, was he to the west or to the east of the
President's car at the time of the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. He would be to the south of it and then west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Southwest of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Talk to anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. And at that time, approximately, well, I was talking to him
at the time this other man came up and told me that he didn't know what it was
about, but he was quite sure the shot had come from this building there which
he pointed out to be the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. He said when the first shot was fired he glanced back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
there was something in the building, he couldn't determine what it was, but
it was just something there that he couldn't explain, but he was definite that
the shots did come from there.</p>

<p>And after talking to him and the man that was on the other side that complained
he was hit by a piece of concrete from the ricochet at that time, I
called the dispatcher and asked for squads to cover the Texas School Book
Depository Building off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what your number was that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Beg your pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what number you used for calling the dispatcher
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes. My original call number is 142.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I have here a Sawyer Deposition Exhibit A, which appears to be
a transcript of a police radio log, and I notice that at 12:35 p.m., there is a
call from 142 to 531. 531 is your station headquarters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to read what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. "I talked to a guy at the scene who says the shots were fired
from the Texas School Book Depository Building with the Hertz Rent A Car sign
on top."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that what you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Approximately. I don't recall the exact words.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There was a response to you. What does it say there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. "Get his name, address, phone number and all information
you can."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No, I never.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Because I was told to go to the School Book Depository Building.
I instructed the three different people to come to the front of the School
Book Depository Building and remain there until they were talked to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You took these people that you had with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I did not take them, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You instructed them to go there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In front of the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And remain there until someone talked to them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know the names of these people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No, I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who talked to them at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. At that time I went to the School Building at the rear location
of it, which would <span class="locked">be&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To the back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. North side of it, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where that door leads out there to the dock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes; on the northeast corner there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. At that time I talked to the colored male that was standing
at the door and asked him how long he had been there, and he said he had been
there some 5 minutes or so.</p>

<p>And I asked him if anyone had came out that door, and he said that they
had not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. At that time, it was people, squads and all arriving at the scene,
and I went on into the building, which they stayed outside, and helped them
search the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. That is about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you search the building on the sixth floor or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you there when they found the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you there when they found the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when the shells were found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I was on the sixth floor when the shells were found. I was still
on the sixth when they found the rifle&mdash;on the fifth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the fifth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Sixth floor, rather, I am sorry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where on the sixth floor were you when the shells were found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I don't recall just exactly where it was at. It was on the floor
there, though. It was just a big open floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you mean they were somewhere on that open floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear someone say they have shells, something like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember who that was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Went up to another location there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw some shells there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you see them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. They were there under the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. On the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. South side or east side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. On the southeast corner facing south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. See any paper bags or anything around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes; there was a lunch bag there. You could call it a lunch bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. There at the same location where the shells were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there a coke bottle or anything with it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Dr. Pepper bottle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. See any long bags which would be a foot or foot and a half or
more long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes; just a plain brown paper bag with tape in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What, tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes; there was just brown paper tape on it. Just a brown
paper bag with paper tape. It had been taped up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long was that, if you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. The exact length, I couldn't say. It was approximately rifle
length.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this have been right under the window, or to the east or
west of the window, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. As I remember, it was directly in the corner, in the southeast
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, as you remember, was the window directly in the southeast
corner, or was the window a little bit to the west of that corner, if you
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. The window at that location faces south, on the southeast
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far from the east corner of the building is the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Well, it is just approximately like that, and then the corner
here. Like the window would be there, and then it would be a corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As far as the window in this room from that corner [indicating in
room]?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I wouldn't even attempt to say the approximate distance of
the window from the corner. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, if you don't know, that is what I want to find out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the bag right under the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. It was in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Not under the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No; it was in the corner of the building, the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you noticed up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, where were you when you saw the&mdash;when you heard a
rifle had been found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. On the floor there, best as I can remember, and I went to that
same location as the other one, just like I stated on the other one where the
shells was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where that rifle was found, roughly, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. It was in a row of books back on the opposite corner. Be on
the west side of the building, back to the northwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, anything else you remember while you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after that, after the rifle was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Well, it still wasn't determined whether the assailant wasn't
still in the building even at that time, even after the rifle was found, and the
search was continued in the building for a while after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. At that time after that I went to the street, went downstairs
to the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you participate in any other investigation that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. On Saturday I was on my way to Colorado.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you weren't around on Sunday either?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No. On Sunday when the other shooting was taking place, I
was knee deep in snow in Colorado.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other information you can think of, whether I have
asked it or not, that in any way would be relevant to the assassination of the
President or the shooting of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No, nothing; I was out of town.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, sir. We thank you very much for your cooperation
here. You have an opportunity, if you want to come down and read this deposition
and sign it before it goes to Washington, or you can waive the reading and
signing of it and just have the court reporter send it directly to us, whatever
you want to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. It makes no difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It makes no difference to us either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Just waive the signing. I don't know when I can get back
over here.</p>

<p>(Officer Haygood was summoned back in a few minutes from across the street
at the Republic National Bank Building to answer the following question.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Officer Haygood, I will continue your deposition with one more
question, if you would, and you are still under oath.</p>

<p>You mentioned in your sworn deposition that you talked to about two people
that you saw, and you pointed it out in your transmission at 12:35 p.m., under
your Call No. 142.</p>

<p>Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice on there another transmission at 12:37 p.m. Could you
read what the transcript has there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Well, this part of the deposition I covered it a while ago but
I gave you, is when I called to have the Texas School Book Depository covered
there. That is one of the witnesses I had that believed the shot came from
that location.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you read what you said there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. It says, "Get men to cover the building, Texas School Book
Depository, believe the shots came from there, facing it on Elm Street looking
at the building it will be the second window from the end in the upper right
hand corner."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you say that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then the transmission made to you, 531 to 142 calling, "How
many do you have there?"</p>

<p>And you made a response which is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. "One guy possibly hit by a ricochet off the concrete and another
seen the President slump."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there two more people in addition to the one that you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. They are still the same people I was referring to back on the
transmission that I made.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many different people did you talk to? One that was possibly
hit by a ricochet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Piece of concrete.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he the one that saw the President slump?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there someone that saw the President slump, and a third
stated it was from the second window from the end in the upper right-hand
corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. I don't recall how many it was. There was quite a chaos
there at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if there were two or more than two?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything about the description of the man
that said that the shot came from the second window from the end in the
upper right-hand corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if he was white or Negro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. He was a white man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Man or woman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether he was young or medium or old?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. That would be a guess on my part. I don't recall. He was just
a medium age.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if he was dressed in a suit or not a suit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Haygood</span>. Best I remember, just sports clothes. I mean, it consisted of
no tie or coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay, thank you, sir.</p>

<h2 id="t302"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_E_D_BREWER" id="TESTIMONY_OF_E_D_BREWER">TESTIMONY OF E.&nbsp;D. BREWER</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of E.&nbsp;D. Brewer was taken at 10 a.m., on April 9, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you stand and raise your right hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you state your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. E.&nbsp;D. Brewer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation, Mr. Brewer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Police officer for the City of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I am 32 years old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You go to school here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you get through school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I graduated from high school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I got married and went to work for the Dallas Power &amp; Light.
About a year later I went into the U.S. Coast Guard and stayed 3 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Honorable discharge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I went to work for the Dallas Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been working for them about 10 years now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Since December 1954.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was your assignment that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was riding solo motorcycle, in the Presidential motorcade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What position were you in in the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was in the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By which car? Near which car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. If I remember correctly, the President's car was about&mdash;the
Chief of Police was in a car immediately in front. The President's car was
behind him, I believe, if I remember correctly, and I was in front of the Chief's
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were in front of the Chief's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were in the lead part of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes. I was the front vehicle. There was four or five of us up
there in a line across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how fast you were going as you went down
Main Street there towards Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir; not exactly. The speed of it would vary considerably
according to the crowd of people on each side of the street as to how we could
get through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you remember how fast you were going as you turned north
on Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. It was in my assignment to leave my position there and go
ahead of the motorcade as we were approaching Houston on Main Street,
and before we got to Houston Street I left. I pulled out ahead of them, and
following the same route, went down to the intersection or to where the motorcade
was to come onto Stemmons Freeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So your speed wasn't necessarily accurate with the motorcade,
is that correct, sometimes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir; I had pulled away from the motorcade on Main Street
and proceeded on down to the Stemmons Freeway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I never did hear any shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was the first time you learned that something was wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was on Stemmons Freeway there where you come onto it,
where the motorcade come onto Stemmons. Went under Stemmons and around
to the right and onto Stemmons, and I was on Stemmons Expressway off of my
motorcycle there on the expressway when I believe I heard it on the radio first
about the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you to stop traffic on the expressway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes. I was to assist some other officers in stopping traffic on
the expressway to allow the motorcade to get onto it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you were in the process of stopping traffic, waiting for the
motorcade to come by, when you heard something on your motorcycle radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far were you from the so-called underpass there, or overpass
there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was to the north of where the railroad track goes over. Let's
see, the railroad track, where the railroad tracks go over Stemmons Expressway.
I was to the north of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me try and get a sketch. Officer, I just stepped out of the
room to come back in and bring a map of Dallas, which I believe is similar to
Commission's Exhibit 371, which I am going to mark here Deposition Exhibit
A, which we will call it E.&nbsp;D. Brewer deposition Exhibit A. I have it marked
in red pencil here, and on this map of Dallas, on one side of it in one corner
of it is a section called, Downtown Dallas, and this is towards the top of the
reverse side of the map.</p>

<p>I am going to ask you to look at this map. You see the place here, it looks
like Dedley Plaza, Main Street runs into that, which is Houston, then you
turned north on Houston and Elm, and then you take Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Left on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Left on Elm. You went under the railroad underpass there,
which appears to be in green on the map, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then I am going to ask you to take a pencil or a ball point pen,
and you might just follow the route that you took. Just mark it parallel to
whatever street you took to where you ended up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. (Marks on map.)</p>

<p>Down Elm under the railroad tracks to Stemmons, under Stemmons to the
right, headed north parallel to Stemmons on that entranceway, under that T &amp; P
Railroad, and onto Stemmons Expressway, and just north of the T &amp; P Railroad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now is that where you stopped your motorcycle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to put an arrow pointing to the spot that you stopped,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, that is the spot right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have it marked kind of with an "X"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. To the best of my knowledge, that is right where we was at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was another officer there at the time when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were they doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. We all proceeded to stop the traffic northbound on Stemmons.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why were you going to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. So that the motorcade which was headed in that direction at
that time could get onto Stemmons and wouldn't be interfered with by the rest
of the traffic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, where were you when you first learned of the shooting
or that something was wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. At that location.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you learn about it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I believe it was on the radio, we heard it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. On the police radio. Well, when it was determined that&mdash;right
after we heard that on the radio, something about it on the radio, we
heard that they were enroute to Parkland Hospital, and immediately after
that they came by us and came onto Stemmons Expressway and went by us in
the direction of Parkland Hospital, the motorcade, part of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. We heard that the shots had came from the Texas School Book
Depository Building, and at that time I got on my motorcycle and proceeded
back up to the Texas School Book Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I went in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir; there was officers all around the building at the time
I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, with some other officers, we was part of the officers that
was searching the building floor by floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now what was your call number that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. 137.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Handing you what has been marked Sawyer Deposition Exhibit
A, which appears to be a transcript of a police log of the Dallas Police Department,
you see this exhibit here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your call number that day was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. 137.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice here that the first time there appears Call No. 137, after
12:30 is at 12:38 p.m.</p>

<p>There is a call from 137 to 531. You want to read what it says there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. "A witness says he saw 'em pull the weapon from the window
off the second floor on the southeast corner of the Depository Building."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that have been the second floor or the second floor from
the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember any witness talking to you at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He said that he had saw him pull a weapon from the window
from that building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what window he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't remember specifically which window he indicated, but
I immediately told that to the dispatcher and proceeded on up to the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I see the conversation continues on the next page. The dispatcher
No. 531, to 137, "Do you have the building covered off?"</p>

<p>And then you reply:</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. "I'm about three-fourths of a block away."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that where you were when this <span class="locked">man&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now from the time you first heard that something was wrong, you
had taken your motorcycle and gone where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were on the Stemmons Freeway when you heard that something
was wrong, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went from Stemmons Freeway where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Up to the Texas School Depository Building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you stop anywhere along the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir; the only time that I stopped was when this guy come up
to me and told it to me, and then was gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you did stop then and talk to this one individual?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which street were you on when you stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was proceeding back up Elm Street the wrong way on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About where were you when this one person talked that said he
saw him pull the weapon in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was down there about the triple underpass on Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean right under the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Or coming to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, coming to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. From the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you have been on the west side of that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, right there about that curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before you left Stemmons Freeway, did you look up or around to
see if there was anything suspicious in that area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. We was all looking up in the railroad tracks from the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anything at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir; we saw some people coming up there, but they seemed to
be up there looking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean you saw people up there searching?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anybody running away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. See anyone acting suspiciously by himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you left that area and came right down the wrong way,
you say, back to retrace your route, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then somewhere in the vicinity of the railroad underpass, you
were stopped by this one individual that you reported on the radio log, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether this man that you talked to was a
white male or a Negro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. He was a white man, the best of my memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything else about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he have any camera or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now after this order to report to the School Book Depository
Building, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I went there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Went in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. By the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had the building been sealed off by the time you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were officers blocking everyone that was coming in, to prohibit
them from coming in and going out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I went inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I proceeded to assist in the floor to floor search of the building
with some other officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What floor did you start on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. On the bottom floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went up to the top?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far up did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. We searched all of it before we quit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, were you ever on the 6th floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you on the sixth floor when you found anything there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you find?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I was on the sixth floor when they found those spent cases from
the rifle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when they found them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I don't know exactly. I was on the floor searching around in
among some boxes that were stacked up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Hear anyone say anything about cartridge cases or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir. Whoever found them turned around and let it be
known to one of the supervisor officers that he had found them, or that they
had been found over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you heard the news?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. I continued searching.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go and take a look at the cartridge cases?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many cartridge cases did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. They were there under, by the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. In the southeast corner of the building, facing south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. See anything else there at the time by the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Paper lunch sack and some chicken bones or partially eaten
piece of chicken, or a piece of chicken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. A drink bottle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What bottle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. A cold drink bottle, soda pop bottle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. In relation to what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anything else in the southeast corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. There was a paper, relatively long paper sack there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. It was there in the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Under the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir. To the left of it. To the east of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To the left as you faced the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the window come right up next to the corner there, do you
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir; it didn't come up next to the corner. It was offset.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Can you remember how far at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir; I don't remember the exact distance of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was any part of the paper sack under the window, if you remember
or not?</p>

<p>That long paper sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything about what the sack looked like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, it was assumed at the time that it was the sack that the
rifle was wrapped up in when it was brought into the building, and it appeared
that it could have been used for that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you mean you assumed that before you found the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir; I suppose. That was discussed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember anything else that was found around there
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Not in that particular area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything found anywhere else in the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir. The rifle was found on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. It was found in a northwest corner under some, in between some
boxes that were stacked up there at the head of the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you there when they found the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far away from the area were you when you found the rifle,
if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Several feet from it. I don't remember exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was it located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. It was laying down low on the door or on the floor down between
some, a very narrow space where boxes were stacked up there, and there
was a space between the boxes, and it was laying down there in between it,
like it had been stuck in there hurriedly, and possibly just before whoever
laid it there went down the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you found of significance in the building at all
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do the rest of the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Well, we proceeded to search the building after that, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
spent, I don't know the exact amount of time we spent in the building after
that, but when Lieutenant Jack Revill was satisfied, we went back downstairs and
I went back out to my motorcycle and to my immediate superior officer and
received another assignment.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the investigation of the
assassination that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir. My primary job was traffic control.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have anything to do with the investigation of Officer
Tippit's murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything that you can think of that might in any way
be relevant to the assassination of the President or the shooting of Officer
Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Not that I can think of; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir, I want to thank you very much for coming on down here.</p>

<p>You have an opportunity, if you like, to come back and read the deposition
and sign it, or else you can waive the signing of it and have it sent directly
to Washington, whichever you prefer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. It don't matter. Whichever you prefer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We have no preference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Okay, you send it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to waive the signing of it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Brewer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Supervising the traffic officers from Main and Field along
the parade route to Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you around 12:30 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. At Main and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the east or west side of Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. West side of Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you watch the motorcade come by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I had started west on Main Street to the, I don't know what
they call this area here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Plaza.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. On the plaza area with the crowd to observe the President
as he went west on Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after you heard those noises? Did you know
they were shots, by the way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. When I saw the first shot and the President's car slow down
to almost a <span class="locked">stop&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you saw the first shot, what do you mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. When I heard the first shot and saw the President's car
almost come to a stop and some of the agents piling off the car, I went back
to the intersection to get my motorcycle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were in the process of doing that when you heard the second
and third shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did the shots sound like they came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I couldn't tell. They were bouncing off the buildings down
there. I couldn't tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the reverberations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I went west on Main to observe the area between the railroad
tracks and Industrial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you go down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. By the way the people, when I went into this area, everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
was hitting the ground, and someone led us to indicate that the shots were coming
into the cars.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean from some point in front of the cars?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know who that someone was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did that person do that indicated that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I went down to Industrial to see if I could see anyone fleeing
that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I didn't see anyone, so I come back to the front of the Book
Depository and went around to this fence that was across the street from Elm
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean across the street from Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Again, I will have to&mdash;near the railroad track.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Behind the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir; this area right here. See, Elm Street goes down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What you are really <span class="locked">saying&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. This area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing to a place between what would be the extension
of Elm that doesn't go down into the parkway but the actual extension
of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes; to the plaza area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The plaza area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you find there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I found a little colored boy, Amos Euins, who told me he
saw the shots come from that building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you just picked out a little small book, one of those little
pocket notebooks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Or a notepad from your pocket here. Is that the original notation
that you made?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you make that notation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Immediately after the shooting.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that your own record that you have kept in your possession
since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir. I <span class="locked">turned&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You turned what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. After I took his name and address and put this information
on the radio, I then took him on the back of my three-wheel motorcycle
and put him in Inspector Sawyer's car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you mentioned that you put something on the radio here, and
I hand you here what has been marked as Sawyer Deposition Exhibit A.
Before doing that, do you remember what call number you used, you were
using on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I believe 260.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I notice here that there is a call with a notation at 12:36
p.m., 260 to 531. 531 is your office in the main station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What does it say there on that transcript?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. "Witness says shots came from fifth floor, Texas Book Depository
store at Houston and Elm. I have him with me now and we are sealing
off the building."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, that was at 12:36 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had the building been sealed off at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Not to my knowledge. There were several officers around
it, but I don't know whether it had been sealed off or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the process of sealing off the building, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Asked for a squad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did it take you after that to have the back part
sealed off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. The squad was arriving by the time I got off my motorcycle.
There was already additional squads en route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How soon after 12:36 p.m., would you say the building was
sealed off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. It was sealed off then because I was back there and two
other men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are talking about the back part of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the front part of the building? When was that
sealed off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Inspector Sawyer and two officers were there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the time you got around to the front part of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir; by the time I put the witness in his car, I went immediately
to the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, as I understand the sequence, you first went to
the back of the building and had that sealed off first, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You tell me what happened then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I had this witness with me. I didn't want to lose this
witness.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. So I took him to the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To Inspector Sawyer's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. To Inspector Sawyer's car, which was right in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which was parked in front of the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. And left the witness there and went around to the back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On whose radio did you call? Did you call in before or after you
left the witness in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I don't remember in exact sequence there, but it was in the
process of going to the car there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. See, here is the thing. The radio traffic was heavy at the
time, and it depended on how long you had to wait to get in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, in any event, after you made the call, what did you do
on the radio? And after you got the man in the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The witness in the car, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Stayed at the back of the building until I was relieved by a
squad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you then went to the back of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you were at Inspector Sawyer's car, did you see him
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he at his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir; he was by his car, near his car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not he had gone inside the building
yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean you don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Don't know whether he had gone in or not. Actually, he
was standing there in front taking information. All the information was being
funneled to Inspector Sawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you tell him you had a witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At that time, had the building been sealed off yet when you told
him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you told Inspector Sawyer that you had a witness that said
the shot came from the building, up to that particular moment, had the front
part of the building been sealed off yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It had already been sealed off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. There was two officers with Inspector Sawyer at the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they stopping people from going in and out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir; I don't know that, because I didn't go up and talk
to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice whether or not people were coming in and out
of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No. I was interested in getting around to the back of the
building to make sure it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then am I correct that your testimony is that you didn't notice
whether people were coming in and out? Did you notice, or did you not notice
whether people were coming out of the building at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Several officers at the area, and it was a lot of people around.
I don't know whether they were going in or out or not. I couldn't say that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went around to the back of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was anyone around in the back when you got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. There were some Secret Service agents there. I didn't get
them identified. They told me they were Secret Service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then did you stay around the back of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes; I stayed at the back until the squad got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I went back to the front, and Inspector Sawyer&mdash;helped to
get the crowd back first, and then Inspector Sawyer assigned me to some
freight cars that were leaving out of the yard, to go down and search all freight
cars that were leaving the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Well, we got a long freight that was in there, and we pulled
some people off of there and took them to the station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean some transients?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Tramps and hoboes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That were on the freight car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. That was all my assignment, because they shook two long
freights down that were leaving, to my knowledge, in all the area there.</p>

<p>We had several officers working in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not anyone found any suspicious people
of any kind or nature down there in the railroad yard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir. We made some arrests, I put some people in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were these what you call hoboes or tramps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were all those questioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir; they were taken to the station and questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any guns of any kind found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to go back to this Amos Euins. Do you remember what
he said to you and what you said to him when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I went in that crowd up there near the area there, and asked
did anyone see any place where the shots come from, and there was an unidentified
person pointed to him, said this boy here saw it, saw the shots, where the
shots came from, and he told me it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did he say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. He told me that the shots came from the window under
the ledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Of what building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Of the School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now have you since gone back to that building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know where the ledge is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir; let's see, I have been by the place a million times.
The ledge there is the one window where it came from, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can't right now definitely state what floor the ledge would
be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If you can't, I would rather not have you guess, but if you do
know, I would like to have you state.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I believe that <span class="locked">it&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant, now, do you know where that ledge is now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Between what floors is the ledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. The ledge is between, over the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, well here in your police report I show you Sawyer
Deposition Exhibit A, you said the, "Witness says shots came from fifth floor
Texas School Book Depository." Did the witness say it was from the sixth floor,
or did he say it was from the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. He said it was from the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were the exact words of the witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. The exact words of the witness "It was under the ledge,"
which would put it on the sixth floor. It was my error in a hasty count of
the floors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the witness say what particular window on that floor that
he saw it on?</p>

<p>On the floor under the ledge?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Said it was the last window, which would indicate it would
be the last window on the east side of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say to his right as he saw it, or did he just say the last
window from where he was standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Last window from where he was standing, and at that point
it would indicate that it would be the last window on the east side of the
building facing Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you standing at the time, on the north or south side of
Elm when you talked to this witness?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you were with this witness, had this Amos Euins, were
you standing on the north or the south side of Elm as it goes into the Parkway
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Elm as it goes under the Parkway&mdash;was between Elm where
it goes under the triple underpass, and the extension of Elm there in that park
area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So that is where you were standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So that would be north of Elm as it goes into the underpass, but
south of the extension of Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Where that building is, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you have been west of the School Book Depository Building
at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So the witness pointed to the last one on that floor? That would
be the last one which would be to the east, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can remember this witness said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say whether or not he saw a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. He couldn't tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant, do you remember anything else that you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you actually talk to any other person whose name you recorded
in your little book there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir; Arnold Rowland.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Arnold Rowland?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. He said that he saw a man on one of those floors. He didn't
clearly identify it, as he saw a man with a high-powered rifle walking around
up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything else that you could have recorded there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Except his address. I have his address as 3026 Hammerly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that happened that day that might in any
way be relevant to this investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Saturday I was assigned to traffic at Elm and Houston, between
Elm and Main.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you did on Saturday or on Sunday
that might in any way be relevant to this area of inquiry?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. On Saturday had a large crowd down there, and I observed
Jack Ruby at the entrance of the jail down there on Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw Jack Ruby near the entrance of the jail on Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Has your statement already been taken by anyone before on the
President's Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But you did see Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I testified in Ruby's trial to that effect.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone else or anything else that might be in any way relevant
here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. The only thing, on Sunday I was leaving town; going to
Whitesboro, and my wife and kids, we heard over the radio that Oswald had
been shot.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Whitesboro, I called Capt. Fritz of the Dallas Police Department,
and told him that I had seen Ruby near the entrance of the county jail the
day before, which was a Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But did you ever talk to Ruby at any time afterwards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir; not afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you know Ruby at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I had met him, and being downtown traffic sergeant, I had
seen him before, and I knew who he was, but other than that, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other thing you can think of, whether I have asked it
or not, that might in any way be relevant to the investigation of the assassination
or the shooting of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir; I don't have anything on that, other than what I
heard over the radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, did your witness ever say whether the person he saw
at the window was a white man or Negro?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. He just told me, he just said he couldn't identify him. That
is what he told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he tell you whether or not it was a man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I don't remember, because I knew I couldn't get any information
out of him, enough to put out a description on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir, we want to thank you very much for coming down here and
testifying.</p>

<p>You have an opportunity, if you would like, to come back and read your deposition
when it is typed, and sign it, or you can waive reading and signing it and
just have the court reporter send the transcript to us directly in Washington.
If you have any preference, you might let us know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I have no preference. I just hope I have been able to help
you on these directions, because they are complicated to give directions, especially
when you try to convince.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In any event, do you want to sign or waive signing? You have
a right to sign or you can waive the signing of it and send it directly to us,
whatever you want to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. Waiver is customary? It doesn't make any difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Some people do one way and some the other way. Do you want
to come back and read it and sign it, or do you want to waive signing it and let
the court reporter send us the transcript direct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. What has most of them been doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Gosh, I have them doing both ways. I couldn't tell you what most
have been doing, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Harkness</span>. I will just waive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. 23 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be then you came to the Police Department around
1941 or so?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. 1941, is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been with them ever since 1941?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Except for a brief hitch in the Service during the war.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do in the Service?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you got out and you went in&mdash;did you go right on the police
force then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I worked as credit manager in a jewelry company. This was
immediately prior to coming to the police department.</p>

<p>Before that, I was a doorman at the Mural Room of the Baker Hotel.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you first got out of high school, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I went out to California and went to work as a clerk in a
grocery store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Came back to Dallas and went to Business College, and then
I went to work as a doorman at the Mural Room of the Baker Hotel.</p>

<p>And then from there I went to the jewelry, and later became credit manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Then to the Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been with the Police Department ever since except for
this time in the Navy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. 47.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Inspector, were you on duty on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the way, were you an Inspector at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you stationed with reference to the motorcade?
Just what were your duties?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I had charge of the crowd detail on Main Street from Akard to
Harwood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After the motorcade passed, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I headed west on Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you immediately get in your car after the motorcade passed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, not immediately, because the crowd was real thick and
completely surrounded the car, but I did as soon as it was feasible to get
back in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where your car was parked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes. It was parked on Ervay Street, at the intersection of
Ervay and Main, but it was, well, it was on the north side of Main Street on
Ervay.</p>

<p>It run parallel to Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you got in your car shortly after the motorcade passed
then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, I headed west, or tried to. I had to wait until the
crowd cleared out, and as soon as the crowd cleared enough, I headed west
on Main Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular reason why you headed west on Main Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Because that was the way the car was pointed at the time I
got in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then what did you do as you went west on Main
Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I just went real slow down the street because of people crossing,
and at the time, the radio broadcast came in about a lot of activity down
at the lower end around Houston and Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what radio broadcast this is?</p>

<p>Who broadcast it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I heard Sheriff Decker come on the radio and tell the dispatcher
to get all of his men over to, and I thought he said Texas School Book
Depository, but at least that was the overall gist of the conversation. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
is what I gathered. He may not have said Texas School Book Depository,
but the Texas School Book Depository was mentioned in the broadcasts that
were made at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was this on Channel 1 or Channel 2 if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Channel 2, I am sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Sheriff Decker have any particular call number at all, or not,
in your police number system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No. I was wondering why he come on our radio, but then I
think that he was with Chief Curry and probably using that radio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, in any event, a call was made from Chief Curry's car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, this I don't know either. I don't know what car it was
made from, but I think it was Sheriff Decker talking. I could recognize his
voice, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Then I went on down to the Texas Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you park your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. In front of the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In front of the main entrance there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. In front of the main entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Immediately went into&mdash;well, talked to some of the officers
around there who told me the story that they had thought some shots had
come from one of the floors in the building, and I think the fifth floor was
mentioned, but nobody seemed to know who the shots were directed at or what
had actually happened, except there had been a shooting there at the time
the President's motorcade had gone by.</p>

<p>And I went with a couple of officers and a man who I believed worked in
the building. The elevator was just to the right of the main entrance, and we
went to the top floor, which was pointed out to me by this other man as being
the floor that we were talking about. We had talked about the fifth floor.</p>

<p>And we went back to the storage area and looked around and didn't see
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you took an elevator up, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The route that you took to the elevator, you went to the front
door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. We got into the elevator. We run into this man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, when you say you got into the elevator, where was the
elevator as you walked in the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. It was to the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it a freight elevator or a passenger elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. The best of my recollection, it was a passenger elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you push for the top button in that elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, I don't know who pushed it, but we went up to the top
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went up to the top floor that the elevator would go to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got off, and were there officers there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. There was one or two other officers with me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you got off, you say you went into the back there into
a warehouse area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Storage area; what appeared to be a storage area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go into any place other than a warehouse or storage area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there anything other than a warehouse or storage area there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, to one side I could see an office over there with people in it.
Some women that apparently were office workers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now Inspector, what did you do then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, I didn't see anything that was out of the ordinary, so I
immediately came back downstairs to check the security on the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say check the security on the building, what do you
mean by that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, to be sure it was covered off properly, and then posted two
men on the front entrance with instructions not to let anyone in or out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the rear entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, I also had the sergeant go around and check to be sure
that all of those were covered, although he told me that they were already
covered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was the order given to cover the front entrance of the
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, they had it covered when I got there. There were officers
all around the front. The only thing I don't think had been done by the time
I got there, was the instructions not to let anybody in or out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, did you give the instructions not to let anyone in
or out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you give those instructions before or after you came down
from the fourth floor or top floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. After I got down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So your procedure, if I understand it, was this. You were driving
on Main Street when you heard Sheriff Decker on the radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Inspector, to try and reconstruct the time of sealing off the building,
I believe you said that before you got to the building, or at about the time
you got to the building, you thought that you heard something about the Texas
School Book Depository over the radio?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At least some time before you left your car, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes; it would have to be, in order to hear it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I have with me the transcript of the radio log here of November
22, and I notice that, according to the log, at 12:30, and you have examined
it, there appears there is a statement by Chief Curry, and then something
by Sheriff Decker concerning, well, we'd better call this Sawyer's
Deposition Exhibit A, which is a transcript of the radio log, and it reads right
now&mdash;we will try and restaple it later on&mdash;but right now, Page 2 and 3 are reversed
insofar as the order is concerned.</p>

<p>You see at 12:28 p.m., on this exhibit Curry calls in that they are near the
triple underpass, and then at 12:30 p.m., it says, "Station Break," is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then the next thing that goes on, it is Number 1, which is Chief
Curry's number, am I correct in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then according to the transcript, the statement is made&mdash;you might
just read it here in front of you: "Go to the hospital, officers, Parkland Hospital,
have them stand by. Get men on top of the underpass, see what happened up
there, go up to the overpass. Have Parkland stand by."</p>

<p>You see these words here, Inspector Sawyer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then on a continuation, "Dallas-1," which is marked in by someone
as Sheriff Decker says: "I'm sure it's going to take some time to get your
men in there. Put every one of my men there."</p>

<p>Then there is a call back to Curry from 531, which is your home station, is
that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>I really didn't quite understand all of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then Curry is quoted as saying: "Notify Station 5 to move all
men available out of my department back into the railroad yard and try to
determine what happened and hold everything secure until homicide and other
investigators can get in there."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That is Decker speaking there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is Decker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You believe that is what Decker said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That is what he said, yes, that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. His number is Dallas-1, and they are talking to 1. They have
that confused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, Curry is 1 also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But I think they were riding in the same car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That might be correct, but this is actually Decker's voice here,
and that is what he had to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, then, the comment is made "Notify Station 5&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That is the Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "To move all men available out of my Department back into the
railroad yard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And that you feel is Decker talking because of the reference to Station 5?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Also, my memory serves that it was his voice that made that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then, at 12:31, is a notation there that quotes, "It looks
like the President has been hit."</p>

<p>Then there doesn't appear to be anything pertaining to where the shots might
have come from until we see at 12:34, there is a call from officer, it says No.
136, that states, "A passer-by states the shots came from Texas School Book
Depository Building.</p>

<p>This is the first reference in the log about the Texas School Book Depository,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you feel that you heard in your car some reference to the
Texas School Book Depository building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be fair for me to assume then that you had not at least
completely left your car by 12:34 p.m?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then when you got to the Texas School Book Depository, well,
you got out of the car and talked to some people or to some officers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Officers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And then what did the officers tell you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That their information was that the shots had come from the
fifth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did any officers give you any other information about the source
of the shots other than the fact that it came from the Texas School Book
Depository, at that particular time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I can't say whether it was officers or who, but there was a
reference also made to the overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, in any event&mdash;pardon me, do you have anything else to
add?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Also, there was a broadcast here in the transcript about the
railroad yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. And this could be part of what I was thinking about, or what
I had heard, was this broadcast on the radio about the railroad yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do? You went inside the building, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. We immediately went inside the building. I took&mdash;I believe
Sgt. Harkness may have gone with me. I am not positive of that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the elevator on the first floor when you got there, or did you
have to wait for it to come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Best of my recollection, it was there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got to the elevator, went up, looked around back there.</p>

<p>How long did you spend up there at the top floor that the elevator took you to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Just took a quick look around and made sure there was nobody
hiding on that floor. I doubt if it took over a minute at the most.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To go up and look around and come down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. To look around on the floor. How long it took to go up, it
couldn't have been over 3 minutes at the most from the time we left, got
up and back down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then that would put it around no sooner than 12:37, if you heard
the call at 12:34?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you got down and what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I asked the Sergeant to doublecheck the security around the
building, and then I took two patrolmen and stationed them at the front door
and told them, with instructions not to let anybody in or out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now up to the time you did this, had anyone else sealed off the
building, that you know of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. When I arrived, the sergeant told me he had the building sealed
off. There were officers all around the building.</p>

<p>To the best of my recollection, there was no officer actually stationed on the
front door, at the front door. There was some on the sidewalk in front of the
front door, and also, as far as I know, had no instructions been issued to anyone
to let anybody in or out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So yours would have been the first instructions to stop traffic
from coming in and out of the front door, am I correct in that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, anybody that would have been seen leaving the building
would have been stopped and interrogated by the officers that were there?</p>

<p>Even before you instructed them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes, because they were looking for something or anything, and
I know that anybody coming out of the back doors, from what the sergeant told
me, they would have stopped them, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened at the front door now. There were people standing
out on the area of the steps, were there not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No. There were some people around, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not any of those would have been
stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. For sure, no; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now after you got down and you issued these orders, then what
did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I set up a command post in front. The various officers were
bringing up different witnesses who had seen various things, and I saw that
this was quite an involved situation. It was so many of these people that had
information, that I knew I didn't have time to take this information down,
and by this time several deputy sheriffs were standing there, and one of them,
I think he was a supervisor, I had his name at one time, I can't think of it
now, was there, and he offered the use of an interrogation room of Sheriff
Decker's office, I think he said, for interrogating these people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is located down the street a little bit there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, it is catty-corner across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. It is southeast across the street from the Texas School Book
Depository, at least from the corner, and so we set up a group of officers and
deputy sheriffs who were to take charge of the witnesses and take them over
to see that affidavits were taken from them.</p>

<p>They were more or less an escort service so the witness wouldn't get away.</p>

<p>And then as our detectives began to show up, I sent them over to the Sheriff's
Office to assist in taking these depositions or affidavits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many witnesses were there around there during this period
of time that you talked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, during the entire period of time that I was there, I would
venture to say between 25 to 50 different people had come up with information
of one kind or another.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, on this radio log, Sawyer's Deposition Exhibit A, do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
notice your number there for any calls at all that might have come in? What
number did you use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I used No. 9. That is my regular call No. 9.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice here a No. 9, the first time that appears to come in here
is at 12:40 p.m.; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That is the first one after 12:40, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The first one after 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. The first one after 12:30, yes, that is true.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then at 12:40, there is a bunch of calls at 12:40, with the next
call number at 12:43, so you assume sometime 12:40 and 12:43 you, as No. 9,
called in, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you read what it says that you said there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. "We need more manpower down here at the Texas Book Depository;
there should be a bunch on Main if somebody can pick them up and
bring them down here."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that said before or after you came down from the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that before or after you told the men there to guard the
front door and not let anyone in or out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now the next time that No. 9 appears is at what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Immediately after 12:43 and before 12:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you say then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. "The wanted person in this is a slender white male about 30,
5 feet 10, 165, carrying what looks to be a 30-30 or some type of Winchester."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then the statement is made from the home office, "It was a
rifle?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I answered, "Yes, a rifle."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then the reply to you, "Any clothing description?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. "Current witness can't remember that."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then the statement is made sometime before 12:45 p.m., and
after the 12:43 p.m., call, "Attention all squads, description was broadcast
and no further information at this time."</p>

<p>Does that mean the description you made was rebroadcast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I rebroadcast that description. That is what that means.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I then notice on this radio log&mdash;I don't see anything more under
9, at least until after the, well, it is down until we have gone as far as 1:30
p.m., I don't see anything else, do you, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No. There is another broadcast in there somewhere, though.
I put out another description on the colored boy that worked in that department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean the colored boy that worked in that depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. He is one that had a previous record in the narcotics, and
he was supposed to have been a witness to the man being on that floor. He
was supposed to have been a witness to Oswald being there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would Charles Givens have been that boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes, I think that is the name, and I put out a description on
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How do you know he was supposed to be a witness on that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Somebody told me that. Somebody came to me with the information.
And again, that particular party, whoever it was, I don't know.
I remember that a deputy sheriff came up to me who had been over taking
these affidavits, that I sent them over there, and he came over from the
sheriff's office with a picture and a description of this colored boy and he
said that he was supposed to have worked at the Texas Book Depository, and
he was the one employee who was missing, or he was missing from the
building.</p>

<p>He wasn't accounted for, and that he was suppose to have some information
about the man that did the shooting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say about the man who did the shooting, did you
know at that time who did the shooting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know about what time in the afternoon this was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Somewhere along in here; let's see if we can't find it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This doesn't go past 1:53 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. What about your other transcript?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I have a transcript of another one here, at least I did have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I think we caught the man in the crowd later and sent him
down.</p>

<p>We sent him directly down to Captain Fritz's office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, just a minute now. I see here on No. 1, you have two
channels there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. This is Channel 1, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We will call this Sawyer's Deposition Exhibit B.</p>

<p>I see here that you go on at 12:45 p.m., with this statement by your No. 9.
You want to read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>"From this building it is unknown if he is still there or not. Unknown if
he was there in the first place."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then it reads back here, "All the information we have received,
indicates it did come from the fifth or fourth of that building."</p>

<p>That is the central headquarters back to you, is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is at least after 12:45 p.m., and before 12:48 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now looking down on this log until the next time your number
appears, is 1:12 p.m. What does that say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. "We have found empty rifle hulls on the fifth floor and from
all indications the man had been there for some time."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then is there anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. This was reported to me by somebody inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That was at 1:12 p.m., that the hulls were found, or at least
shortly prior to that? This doesn't say anything else. It apparently doesn't
go in detail much past 1:58 p.m., on Sawyer Deposition Exhibit B, and 1:53
p.m., on Sawyer's Deposition Exhibit A.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you still feel sometime after that you might have called out
another description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. It was another, sometime after that, or it has been left out of
this. I don't think it has been left out of this, but it must have been after
1:53.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, sir; you did broadcast that description out of this
man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes, that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That shows on the radio log. Where did you get that description
from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. We are talking now about the colored man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, I am talking about the one that is on Sawyer's Deposition
Exhibit A, that shows you at 12:43.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. That description came to me mainly from one witness who
claimed to have seen the rifle barrel in the fifth or sixth floor of the building,
and claimed to have been able to see the man up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know this person's name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I do not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know anything about him, what he was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Except that he was&mdash;I don't remember what he was wearing.
I remember that he was a white man and that he wasn't young and he wasn't
old. He was there. That is the only two things that I can remember about
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What age would you categorize as young?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Around 35 would be my best recollection of it, but it could be a
few years either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if he was tall or short, or can't you remember
anything about him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I can't remember that much about him. I was real hazy about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember where he said he was standing when he saw
the person with the rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I didn't go into detail with him except that from the best of
my recollection, he was standing where he could have seen him. But there
were too many people coming up with questions to go into detail. I got the
description and sent him on over to the Sheriff's Office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Inspector, do you remember anything else about this person who
you say gave you the primary description?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No, I do not, except that I did send him with an escort to the
Sheriff's Office to give fuller or more complete detail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know if he was taken there to see a lineup at the police
station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you talked to other people there that said they had some
information with regard to where the shots may have come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes, through a number of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. First I am going to ask you if you talked to any other people who
said they saw a rifle or part of a rifle?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes. There were a few who claimed that they had seen this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did these people that claimed they saw a rifle or part of a
<span class="locked">rifle&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. The ones that I talked to were pointing out one of the upper
floors of the Texas School Book Depository, which at that time I thought was
the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what portion, what side of the building it was?</p>

<p>Was it the northeast corner or west side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. It was on the south side of the building, and in the southeast
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about this person, who I will call the primary description
witness, did he say what side of the building it was on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. He went and pointed out the window which I now note to be
the sixth floor, but when I talked to him, I thought it was the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. On the south side of the building, and the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to any witness, or did any witness talk to you who
claimed to see any rifle or portion of a rifle at any place other than a window
of Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No, did <span class="locked">any&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did any officer give you any information about talking to anyone
who saw a rifle or a portion of a rifle at any place other than a window in the
Texas School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No, not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to people who attempted to locate the shots on the
basis of what I would call their sense of hearing, rather than their sense of
sight?</p>

<p>In other words, what they heard rather than what they saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Correct. That is correct. Some of them claimed that they
had heard shots, or thought they heard shots from over the overpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did all the people you talked to say that they heard shots over
the overpass? Claim they had some knowledge about where the shots came
from?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
Did they all say they heard shots from the overpass, or did they say they
heard some from other places?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No. Very few said they heard the shots come from the overpass,
or thought they heard them from that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, where did other people say they heard shots come from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Most of the people that heard the shots pointed out the Texas
Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did some of the people that heard shots, or thought they heard
shots from the Texas School Book Depository, all say they saw a rifle there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Most of them say they saw a rifle there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No, just a few, very few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you can think of that occurred at the
Texas School Book Depository that afternoon while you were there that might
have any relevancy about where the shots came from, other than what you
have told thus far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Well, I had heard some of the officers come to me and said
there was supposed to be, somebody told them about a woman that had taken
some pictures of that window, and then one of the sergeants came to me, and
I am not sure who the sergeant is now, but anyway he said that there was
on the building immediately west&mdash;east, I am sorry&mdash;east of the Texas School
Book Depository, that a man up in one of the upper windows up there was
taking some moving pictures of what had gone on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever contact this man? Do you know what his name is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No; I don't know his name. The sergeant told me that the man
would not give them the pictures, that he was waiting for the Secret Service
or the FBI, I forget which now, and I sent the sergeant and two men back
over there with instructions to bring that man and his pictures to me.</p>

<p>When they got back over there, Forrest Sorrels of the Secret Service was
already there, and at least they so reported back to me, and was talking to this
man.</p>

<p>So I told them to go ahead with their normal assignments and since Forrest
was already there and talking to him, I knew that that part would be taken
care of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know what his name was or what the results of it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Later that afternoon one of our colored officer detectives saw
this colored man in this crowd across the street and we had previously broadcast
a description on, and he took him into custody and sent him immediately
down to Captain Fritz' office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He gave a statement, is that it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. This I don't know. I presume he did, but I didn't stop to talk
to him or take any information.</p>

<p>I just sent him on down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of at this time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You spent most of the afternoon out in front of the building there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I spent most of the afternoon up until 4 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I went back down to the City Hall and checked around there to
see if anything further I could do, and then I went home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do on Saturday, the 23d? Anything that has to
do with the assassination or the investigation of the Tippit murder?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. No. I happened to be off on Saturday, and I didn't go back
down. The boss didn't call me, so I stayed home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about Sunday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Same thing. In fact, I didn't even hear about the other thing
until way late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other information that you can think of, whether I
have asked it or not, that might be in any way relevant here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. The only other thing I can remember that I did down there, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
when the shooting on Officer Tippit came in, I released half a dozen men to go
to Oak Cliff to help with that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Inspector, is there anything else that you can think of, whether I
have asked it or not, that is in any way relevant here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. I can't think of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir, we certainly appreciate your cooperation in coming down
here.</p>

<p>You have a right, if you would like, after this report is typewritten, to read
it and sign it before it is sent to us, or you can waive the reading of it and
have it sent to us directly.</p>

<p>It doesn't make a bit of difference to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Whichever you prefer. It doesn't make any difference to me.</p>

<p>I would like to read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why don't we say you read it and sign it, and it will be sent to us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sawyer</span>. Okay.</p>

<h2 id="t325"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_GERALD_DALTON_HENSLEE" id="TESTIMONY_OF_GERALD_DALTON_HENSLEE">TESTIMONY OF GERALD DALTON HENSLEE</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Gerald Dalton Henslee was taken at 4 p.m., on April 8, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant, do you want to stand and raise your right hand, please,
to be sworn.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give is the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you please state your name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Gerald Dalton Henslee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. A police officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For what police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. City of Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you been a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. 16 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are a sergeant now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Sergeant.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do before you became a police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. I was a student in SMU.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At SMU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Prior to that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. I was a dance instructor at the Arthur Murray Dance Studio.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And prior to that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. I was in the United States Army.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Honorable discharge, sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. 40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Married?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sergeant, what were your duties on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. I was supervising the radio dispatcher's office at the Dallas
Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you just describe your duties there as to what they included?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Well, in this instance, I was not only supervising the channel
1 radio and the incoming radio calls, but was the police dispatcher for channel
2, covering the special event of the arrival of the President of the United States,
President Kennedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were your hours of work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. My assigned hours?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. 6:30 until 2 p.m. 6:30 a.m. until 2:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you stay on after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. I stayed until about 5:30, as I recall, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mentioned channel 2. How many channels do you have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Two channels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was channel 2 being used for the motorcade that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to hand you what has been marked Sawyer Deposition
Exhibit A, and ask you to state if you know what this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes. This is a transcript of the radio log of that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For what channel?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Channel 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Covering from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. From 10:25 a.m., until 1:53 p.m.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I notice on the covering page it says that: "The following
was recorded on channel 2, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. This report includes information
prior to the arrival of the President's plane, progress of the motorcade,
the shooting, and the escort to Parkland Hospital. Also included are events
concerning the shooting of Officer Tippit."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you attempted to cover all calls that occurred that day or
just the calls pertaining to the subject matter that is included in the covering
paragraph.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Pertaining to the subject matter, to the covering paragraph
only.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, I hand you what has been marked Sawyer Deposition
Exhibit B, and ask you to state if you know what this is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is Sawyer Deposition Exhibit B?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. That is a transmission pertaining to the shooting of President
Kennedy and Officer Tippit on channel 1.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, I notice times on Sawyer Deposition Exhibits A and B.
Does this mean a time according to your police clock there when an event
happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For instance, on Sawyer Deposition Exhibit A, I see until 12:40
p.m., a number of conversations. Then the next one is 12:43 p.m. Does that
mean that all the conversations took place between 12:40 and 12:43 p.m.?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They took place in the order in which they are listed here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Right. There were so many, we couldn't get the time in after
each transmission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who prepared Sawyer Deposition Exhibits A and B, if you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Well, I am pretty sure these are the ones I prepared. They
are copies of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know from what source they were prepared?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. They were prepared from the tapes on the channel 1. We
have a tape on channel 1, and we have a record on channel 2. Two separate
tape records, but they are prepared from those records and tapes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Under your supervision?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I notice numbers here. For instance, I see on Sawyer Deposition
Exhibit A, the No. 531 often appears. Would that be your call number?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. This designates the radio dispatcher.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then I see the number here, No. 1 sometimes appears. Who is
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. That is the number assigned to Chief J.&nbsp;E. Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I see a No. 9. Who is No. 9?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. That is the number assigned to Inspector J.&nbsp;H. Sawyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Different numbers are assigned to different people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If an officer is patrolling a district, does he have the number
assigned to a district if he is not a high officer in the Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For instance, I see the No. 78 here. Does that appear to be the
number of J.&nbsp;D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. On that particular day it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, anything else you can think of, Sergeant, that might
be relevant to the investigation into the assassination of the President or the
shooting of Officer Tippit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. No. The only thing I have is what I observed over the police
radio that day. That is all the knowledge I have at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, sir; we thank you very much for your cooperation.</p>

<p>One other thing, you have the right to read this deposition and sign it before
it goes into Washington, or else you can waive the reading and have it go
directly to Washington.</p>

<p>Do you have any preference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. Yes, I would like to read it before I sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is all right. It makes no difference to us. And again, we
thank you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Henslee</span>. What else can I do for you?</p>

<h2 id="t327"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_WILLIAM_H_SHELLEY" id="TESTIMONY_OF_WILLIAM_H_SHELLEY">TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM H. SHELLEY</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of William H. Shelley was taken at 4:10 p.m., on April 7,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you hold up your right hand and be sworn?</p>

<p>(Witness complying.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you will give here today
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Sit down and state your name and your address.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. William Hoyt (spelling) Shelley, 126 South Tatum, Dallas 11.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you tell me something about yourself, where you were born
<span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I was born at Gunter, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. High school.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What have you been doing since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I worked in defense plants a little bit during the war and
started working at the Texas School Book Depository October 29, 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. (After leaving room for last answer, Mr. Ball returns.) Did
you tell her all about yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. You wanted to know when I was born.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told us that, and you had your high school education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work have you done since then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I've told her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you worked at Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. She already has it, October 29, 1945.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. October 29, 1945&mdash;steady since that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In November 1963, what was your job down there?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, I am manager of the miscellaneous department and
have been for several years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is your immediate superior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Roy S. Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He is superintendent of the place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He worked for me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work did he do for you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He did good work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He did good work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Order filling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As an order filler did he have access to any more than one floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Just about any of them outside the offices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there certain floors that he worked more upon which he
worked more frequently than other floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. The first floor is where all the order filling is done; the 5th, 6th,
7th floor are used for storage and when they need stock on the first floor anybody
goes up and gets it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So he would work mostly on the first floor and sometimes on 5,
6, and 7, is that what you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Not too much; he wasn't too talkative. If I had something I
wanted him to do, I would tell him and he usually did it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. His work was satisfactory?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November 1963, did you see him come to work that
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, he was at work when I got there already filling orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him from time to time during that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I am sure I did. I do remember seeing him when I came down
to eat lunch about 10 to 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where had you been working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I had been on the sixth floor with the boys laying that floor
that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go down and eat lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It was around 10 'til.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you eat your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, I started eating.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you start eating it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. In my office next to Mr. Truly's and I ate part of it which
I do usually and finish up later on in the day but I went outside then to the
front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you go to the front?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Oh, several people were out there waiting to watch the motorcade
and I went out to join them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, there was Lloyd Viles of McGraw-Hill, Sarah Stanton,
she's with Texas School Book, and Wesley Frazier and Billy Lovelady joined
us shortly afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were standing where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Just outside the glass doors there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be on the top landing of the entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the motorcade pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, I heard something sounded like it was a firecracker and
a slight pause and then two more a little bit closer together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I didn't think anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did it sound like to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Sounded like a miniature cannon or baby giant firecracker,
wasn't real loud.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened; what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I didn't do anything for a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What seemed to be the direction or source of the sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Sounded like it came from the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It sounded like it came from the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Gloria Calvary from South-Western Publishing Co. ran back
up there crying and said "The President has been shot" and Billy Lovelady
and myself took off across the street to that little, old island and we stopped there
for a minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Across the street, you mean directly south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, slightly to the right, you know where the light is there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. That little, old side street runs in front of our building and Elm
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It dead ends?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. There's concrete between the two streets.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Elm Street dead ends there just beyond the building, doesn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, that's also Elm that goes under the triple underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is Elm that goes under the triple underpass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to the concrete between the two Elm Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, where they split.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went out there and then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, officers started running down to the railroad yards and
Billy and I walked down that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get down that way; what course did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. We walked down the middle of the little street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The dead-end street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Truly, Mr. Truly and an officer go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yeah, we saw them right at the front of the building while
we were on the island.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. While you were out there before you walked to the railroad yards?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any idea how long it was from the time you heard
those three sounds or three noises until you saw Truly and Baker going into
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It would have to be 3 or 4 minutes I would say because this
girl that ran back up there was down near where the car was when the President
was hit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She ran back up to the door and you had still remained standing
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Going to watch the rest of the parade were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The Vice President hadn't gone by, had he, by your place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I don't know. I didn't recognize him. I did recognize Mr.
Kennedy and his suntan I had been hearing about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to see Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. We ran out on the island while some of the people that were
out watching it from our building were walking back and we turned around
and we saw an officer and Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Truly?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see them go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No; we didn't watch that long but they were at the first step
like they were fixin' to go in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they moving at the time, walking or running?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Well, they were moving, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were they running?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. That, I couldn't swear to; there were so many people around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you and Billy Lovelady do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. We walked on down to the first railroad track there on the
dead-end street and stood there and watched them searching cars down there
in the parking lots for a little while and then we came in through our parking
lot at the west end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the west end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; and then in the side door into the shipping room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you came into the shipping room did you see anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I saw Eddie Piper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He was coming back from where he was watching the motorcade
in the southwest corner of the shipping room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of the first floor of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who else did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. That's all we saw immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see Vickie Adams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I saw her that day but I don't remember where I saw her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember whether you saw her when you came back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It was after we entered the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think you did see her after you entered the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir; I thought it was on the fourth floor awhile after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did the police come into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir; they started coming in pretty fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go with them any place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; Mr. Truly left me guarding the elevator, not to let anybody
up and down the elevator or stairway and some plainclothesmen came in;
I don't know whether they were Secret Service or FBI or what but they wanted
me to take them upstairs, so we went up and started searching the various
floors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go up on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you there when they found anything up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I was, I believe I was on the sixth floor when they found the
gun but we were searching all parts of that floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you find any chicken bones up there or see any?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, I went up later on that day; I believe after we had gotten
back from City Hall with someone, I don't remember who it was, one of the
officers and they got them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They did what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. They got the bones.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. They were on the third&mdash;yeah, it would be the third window
from the southeast corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were they in a sack?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Laying on a sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Laying on a sack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir; with a coke bottle sitting in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any other chicken bones anyplace around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the only ones?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody eating fried chicken on that floor that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. At one time I think I said I did but Charles Givens was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
guy that was eating and he was further on over toward the west side and he
was eating a sandwich so he says.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now you say that you thought that you had seen someone had eaten
fried chicken that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I thought I had; those colored boys are always eating chicken.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you think you did or do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I asked Charles Givens whether it was him that was eating
and he said it was a sandwich.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that before you went down for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir; it was pretty early in the morning, about 9:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It was two-thirds across the building toward the west because
I didn't put plywood over there and he didn't get too far from where we were
actually working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you heard these noises you said sounded like firecrackers this
girl came up and said the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were still standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was still some time lapse from the time you heard the noise
like a firecracker and she came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went out across Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, to the divider.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Between the two Elm Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The one street dead ends and the other street that goes on down
under the viaduct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you run out to the point or walk out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I believe we trotted out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stay very long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Oh, it wasn't very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Maybe a minute or two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that's the place you saw Truly and Baker, you say, going
into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went down the Elm Street that dead ends to the first
railroad track?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's about what distance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Approximately 100 yards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you trot, run or walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. We were walking but it was a pretty fast walk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stay there any length of time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Not very long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long would you say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I wouldn't say over a minute or minute and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went back to the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you trot or run back to the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. We just walked back; took our good, old easy time more or less.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you went into the west end?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Vickie Adams after you came into the building and did
you see her on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I sure don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald use a clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On which he kept his orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it a clipboard you gave him to use or <span class="locked">one&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. It's one he picked up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Picked up where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Just laying around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There are clipboards that the order fillers use there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yeah, some of them are on bakelite and some we just use a clip
and maybe a piece of cardboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he use the same one at all times?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; as far as I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now at a later time do you remember a clipboard being found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know who found it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Frankie Kaiser.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did he find it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He found it on the sixth floor in the corner of the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he show you the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Point it out to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; so I invited Mr. <span class="locked">Pinkston&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Pinkston of the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he come out and get the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; he got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But Frankie Kaiser pointed it out to you, did he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you called the FBI and pointed it out to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He was down there at the time and I told him about it and
he and Frankie and I went up and got it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; that, I sure couldn't tell you. It was the following
week though, I am pretty sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean after the 22d, the following, you say, the 22d of
November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine that clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine it to see whether or not there was on the clipboard
any orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Unfilled orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir; there were some invoices on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you able to identify those invoices and state to whom they
had been assigned to fill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. They were Scott, Foresman invoices.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Scott, Foresman invoices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir; and he filled mostly Scott, Foresman orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is "he"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald filled mostly Scott, Foresman orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is Foresman [spelling]?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Foresman [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any other order filler who filled Scott, Foresman invoices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Any of the other boys would if they ran out of other publishers'
orders. When I get those orders, I sort them according to publishers and during
rush season like that, usually, have one guy sticking as close to one publisher
as he can because skipping back and forth you have different codes and everything
and it is confusing to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So, in the morning would you have assigned all Scott, Foresman
to Oswald on that Friday morning?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He already had the orders and was working when I got there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who would determine what orders they would get?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. When we run out of orders they get to one of the boxes and
get orders for Scott, Foresman. He had been trained for Scott, Foresman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would orders be assigned the day before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; we don't definitely assign them to anyone. The boys
know what they can fill best and as long as they are putting the work <span class="locked">out&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I want to know how a man working on Scott, Foresman&mdash;suppose
Oswald came to work on Friday morning, tell me what routine he would follow,
where he would get the orders he was to fill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. He would go over to the order desk and get them out of a box
marked Scott, Foresman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They would have Scott, Foresman on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is he the only one that in the morning when he came to work
would get the orders out of the box marked Scott, Foresman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; if there wasn't any orders in any of the other boxes
any other order filler would take them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know whether or not he was filling Scott, Foresman
orders that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; not for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know whether anybody else was filling Scott, Foresman
orders that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I am sure they were; that's our biggest publishers; there's more
of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you believe others besides Oswald were filling Scott, Foresman
orders that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Probably were.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there any way you can determine what order filler had that
clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir; it's one that looked like the one he had used.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It did look like the one he had used?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There were how many unfilled orders on that clipboard when it
was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Two or three, best I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you keep a list of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody make a list of them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Not unless Mr. Pinkston did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Pinkston of the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes; he called in about the thing and in a little while he released
it and said go ahead and fill the orders which we did because they were
several days old.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean those orders that were on that clipboard had never
been filled?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So you went ahead and filled them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How do you spell his name&mdash;Pinkston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I don't know how to spell it. Mr. Pinkston is all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Pinkston, okay. I think that's all, Mr. Shelley. Thanks very
much. This will be written up and you can come down and read it and sign
it or we can waive signature; which would you rather do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I suppose it doesn't make any difference. What are the others
doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Some waived, some insist on reading it; which would you rather do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. I would kind of like to see it for curiosity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Come down and sign it, all right. Where was the clipboard found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. On the sixth floor in the far corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. By the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be the northwest?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Shelley</span>. Northwest, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, fine. Thank you very much, Mr. Shelley.</p>

the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Nat A. Pinkston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I'm a Special Agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you had your deposition taken before this proceeding?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your address is what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. My residence address is 2106 Van Cleave Drive, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long have you been a Special Agent for the Federal Bureau
of Investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Be 24 years next month.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you are assigned to what office?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you did not receive a letter from the Commission asking you
to testify, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were asked to come over here by Mr. Shanklin?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At my request, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Well, <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anyway, you were asked to come over here by Mr. Shanklin and
he advised you that your deposition would be taken at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The deposition taken in the course of an investigation by the Commission
to investigate the facts concerning the circumstances surrounding the
assassination of President Kennedy, and I am a staff officer. My name is Joseph
A. Ball. I am authorized to administer the oath to you and to ask you certain
questions concerning some matters which you do have knowledge of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are willing to testify, are you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the course of your investigation, were you called to the Texas
School Book Depository sometimes around the 2d of December 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who asked you to come down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I was instructed by one of my supervisors to conduct an investigation
there on that date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a fellow by the name of Frankie Kaiser?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Roy Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they tell you when you came down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. To the best of my recollection I was there waiting to see Mr.
Truly. He was somewhere else in the building, and I was waiting for him on
the occasion in question. Frankie Kaiser came down the stairs and said
that he had found something on the sixth floor. I didn't&mdash;I then accompanied
him back to the sixth floor where he pointed out on the floor near the entrance
to the stair well, a clipboard with some orders on it, and&mdash;pardon me a second,
do you want me to testify to what Kaiser told me, which is <span class="locked">hearsay&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is all right, but Kaiser told you that when you were downstairs,
that something&mdash;didn't he? When he was&mdash;did Kaiser come downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes; Kaiser came downstairs and took me back upstairs with
him and pointed out the clipboard which he had left on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say he had left it there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. He had seen it there and did not bother it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. He did not put it there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see. Kaiser told you and you went upstairs and Kaiser pointed
out the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. First, the location of the clipboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. The clipboard was generally in the northwest corner of the
sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. It was on the floor behind the
books, against the wall of the stair well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There were some book cartons in front of it, were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did Frankie Kaiser say something? That is hearsay, but
I would like to hear what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. He told me this clipboard was the one that he had made, and
had given to Oswald when Oswald went to work at the School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it have anybody's name on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. It had quite a bit of scribbling on it, and I believe&mdash;well,
I am not in a position to say right now exactly what it had on it other than
some orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It did have some orders on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you examine the orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me the date of the orders and the general description
of the orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Three orders on this clipboard. Each order was dated November
22d. The first was an order from Mrs. Hazel Carroll of the Reading Clinic,
SMU, for one Parliamentary Procedure at $1.40. Was published by Scott,
Foresman &amp; Co.</p>

<p>And this invoice bore No. 2454. The second one was an order from Dallas
Independent School District from Mr. M.&nbsp;J. Morton, purchasing agent, at the
School Administration Building, 3700 Ross Avenue, Dallas, Tex., for 10 ERS,
Basic Reading Skills, for high schools, revised, at $1.12, or total of $11.20.
Published by Scott, Foresman &amp; Co.</p>

<p>The Invoice was No. 6057.</p>

<p>The third order was an order to be sent to Mr. M.&nbsp;K. Baker, Junior High
School, Reynosa, New Mex., for one TE Basic Reading Skills. J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;S. use.
No charge. Sent at the request of Miss Mary Williams. Publisher; Scott,
Foresman &amp; Co., invoice 8291.</p>

<p>Each of these orders, as I say, were dated November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do when you&mdash;with the orders after you made
these notations?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I turned them over to Mr. Truly. He desired to fill the orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with the clipboard?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I returned the clipboard to my office and made an exhibit
of it, as I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it still an exhibit? It is an FBI exhibit?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In the possession of the FBI?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I haven't seen it since then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you try to determine if you still have that as an exhibit in
your office, or in Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Now, this will be written up and will be submitted to you for your signature,
or you can waive your signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. I would like <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. See it and read it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Pinkston</span>. See it and read it and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You will be notified to come to this office and read it and sign it.</p>

<p>(After the conclusion of the deposition and at 1 o'clock, p.m., on the same
day as the taking of the deposition, Mr. Nat A. Pinkston appeared before me,
Iris Leonard, stating that he wished the following statement to be incorporated
with his deposition: "After reviewing my records, I am now able to state definitely
that after examining the clipboard and the orders thereon, I left them
at the Texas School Book Depository with Mr. Truly. The clipboard was picked
up by another FBI agent at a later time and was made an exhibit.")</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You received a letter from the Commission, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know the purpose of the investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me something about yourself, where you were born
and what your education was and your experience, in general?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, I was born at Myrtle Springs, Tex., 1937, February 19,
and lived there for about 20 years until I went into the service and I did nursery
work and that's about all there is, farm work down there and nursery and stuff
like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you go to work for Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. December 16, 1961, I believe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work did you do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, they hired me when I went there as a truck driver,
drove truck until another job as stockman was open, taking care of the stock
that comes in, see that it's put in the right place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which one of the buildings do you work in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. At the one at 411 Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22, 1963, where were you working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. At that morning, you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I was working on the sixth floor putting&mdash;we was putting down
that flooring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who were you working with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, there was Bonnie Ray Williams and Danny Arce and
Slim, Charles Givens; we call him Slim, and let me see, well Mr. Shelley would
come up every once in while, check on us. He wasn't workin' with us but he
would come up see how we gettin' along.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's Mr. Shelley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Mr. Bill Shelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his position with Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. He would be under Mr. R.&nbsp;S. Truly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is he a foreman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I guess you would call it that. He takes care of most things
down there, paperwork and stuff like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well just to work with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, I never did carry on any long conversations or anything
like that, maybe, you know, "Hello," or I asked him a few times how his little
baby was getting along; he told me it was doing fine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did Oswald work in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, he had access to all the building just like I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. All floors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Any floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Any floor; I mean he didn't have no business in the office. I
mean, or to if, say, like Mr. Truly would say "Okay, Lee, go up and give me a
certain something from the office," he could go up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he work on one floor more than any other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. No; I wouldn't say because there's different publishers on each
order and he has to go to different floors to get books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald ever eat lunch with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. He ate two or three times in that little domino room, but not
by himself, with the rest of the boys.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him come to work that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him carry a sack or anything in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. No, sir; just lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he usually carry his lunch or did he buy his lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Most of the time he had fruit and stuff like that, grapes and
raisins, stuff like that I noticed a few times he had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you quit work that day or knock off for lunch that
day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Same time, 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A little before 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, we came down at 10 minutes til to wash up and get ready
for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you come down the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did you go down with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Let me see, I think it was Bonnie Ray Williams on the side
I was; I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you having a race with the other boys?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, sir; sure was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything or hear anything of Oswald on the way down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes; he was on the opposite side of the elevator I was on. I
heard him holler to one of the boys to stop, he wanted the elevator. They said,
"No; we're going down to lunch," and closed the gate I was on and come down
and got ready to watch the President come by or got ready to go to lunch, and
that's the last I heard of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were on the west elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald was standing in front of the east elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. East, on back, the elevator back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. No; I didn't; I just heard his voice because&mdash;where those slats
are in back of the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him again that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after you went down and washed up; what did
you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, I went over and got my lunch and went upstairs and got
a coke and come on back down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Upstairs on what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. That's on the second floor; so, I started going to the domino
room where I generally went in to set down and eat and nobody was there and I
happened to look on the outside and Mr. Shelley was standing outside with
Miss Sarah Stanton, I believe her name is, and I said, "Well, I'll go out there
and talk with them, sit down and eat my lunch out there, set on the steps," so
I went out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You ate your lunch on the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Bill Shelley and Sarah Stanton, and right behind <span class="locked">me&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was that last name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Stanton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Bill Shelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Stanton's first name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Miss Sarah Stanton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stay on the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you there when the President's motorcade went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, sir; sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I thought it was firecrackers or somebody celebrating the
arrival of the President. It didn't occur to me at first what had happened until
this Gloria came running up to us and told us the President had been shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was this girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Gloria Calvary.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Gloria Calvary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where does she work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Southwestern Publishing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the direction of the sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right there around that concrete little deal on that knoll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's where it sounded to you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, sir; to my right. I was standing as you are going down
the steps, I was standing on the right, sounded like it was in that area.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the underpass area?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Between the underpass and the building right on that knoll.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have got a picture here, Commission Exhibit 369. Are you on
that picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Take a pen or pencil and mark an arrow where you are.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Where I thought the shots are?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; you in the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Oh, here (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Draw an arrow down to that; do it in the dark. You got an arrow
in the dark and one in the white pointing toward you. Where were you when
the picture was taken?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right there at the entrance of the building standing on the
top of the step, would be here (indicating).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were standing on which step?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. It would be your top level.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The top step you were standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when Gloria came up you were standing near Mr. Shelley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When Gloria came up and said the President had been shot, Gloria
Calvary, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, I asked who told her. She said he had been shot so
we asked her was she for certain or just had she seen the shot hit him or&mdash;she
said yes, she had been right close to it to see and she had saw the blood and
knew he had been hit but didn't know how serious it was and so the crowd had
started towards the railroad tracks back, you know, behind our building there
and we run towards that little, old island and kind of down there in that little
street. We went as far as the first tracks and everybody was hollering and
crying and policemen started running out that way and we said we better get
back into the building, so we went back into the west entrance on the back dock
had that low ramp and went into the back dock back inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. First of all, let's get you to tell us whom you left the steps with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Mr. Shelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Shelley and you went down how far?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, I would say a good 75, between 75 to 100 yards to the
first tracks. See how those tracks <span class="locked">goes&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went down the dead end on Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And down to the first tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. No sir; well, just people running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. And hollerin.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to go down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I don't know, because everybody was running from that way
and naturally, I <span class="locked">guess&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were running from that way or toward that way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Toward that way; everybody thought it was coming from that
direction.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By the time you left the steps had Mr. Truly entered the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. As we left the steps I would say we were at least 15, maybe 25,
steps away from the building. I looked back and I saw him and the policeman
running into the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Twenty, 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Steps away and you looked back and saw him enter the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you came back. How long did you stay around the railroad
tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Oh, just a minute, maybe minute and a half.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Came back right through that part where Mr. Campbell, Mr.
Truly, and Mr. Shelley park their cars and I came back inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And enter from the rear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, sir; sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard the shots. And how long after that was it before Gloria
Calvary came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Oh, approximately 3 minutes, I would say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Three minutes is a long time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, it's&mdash;I say approximately; I can't say because I don't
have a watch; it could.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had people started to run?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Well, I couldn't say because she came up to us and we was
talking to her, wasn't looking that direction at that time, but when we came
off the steps&mdash;see, that entrance, you have a blind side when you go down the
steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right after you talked to Gloria, did you leave the steps and go
toward the tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you run or walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Medium trotting or fast walk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. A fast walk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to turn around and see Truly and the policeman
go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Somebody hollered and I looked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You turned around and looked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After you ran to the railroad tracks you came back and went
in the back door of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go in through the docks, the wide open door or did you
go in the ordinary small door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. You know where we park our trucks&mdash;that door; we have
a little door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is where you went in, that little door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be the north end of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. That would be the west end, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it the one right off Houston Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. No; you are thinking about another dock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I am?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes; we have two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have a dock on the west side and one on the north side
of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. East, and well, it would be east and west but you enter it
from the south side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, the south <span class="locked">side&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Elm Street is that little dead-end street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I drive my truck here (indicating) but we came in from this
direction; that would have to be west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You came into the building from the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Through that, those raised-up doors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Through the raised-up doors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Through that double door that we in the morning when we
get there we raised. There's a fire door and they have two wooden doors
between it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You came in through the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did you see in the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I saw a girl but I wouldn't swear to it it's Vickie.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is Vickie?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. The girl that works for Scott, Foresman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is her full name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I wouldn't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Vickie Adams?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I believe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you say it was Vickie you saw?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I couldn't swear.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was the girl?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I don't remember what place she was but I remember seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
a girl and she was talking to Bill or saw Bill or something, then I went over
and asked one of the guys what time it was and to see if we should continue
working or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any other people on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Oh, yes; by that time there were more; a few of the guys had
come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you stayed on the first door then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I would say 30 minutes. And one of the policemen asked me
would I take them up on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take them up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes, sir; I sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mr. Lovelady, your testimony will be written up and it can be
submitted to you for your signature if you wish and you can make any changes,
or you can waive signature and we will make this your <span class="locked">final&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. I want this to be the final one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right; you waive signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Lovelady</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thanks very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You started to work over at the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes&mdash;then I got married.</p>

worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Not personally&mdash;I would know him when I would see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Same building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when the President's parade went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. At the Baylor Dental College.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Sir, you weren't anywhere near the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. No, sir; I was off Thursday and Friday with abscessed tooth.
I was sitting in the chair and when I got off, we was out in the lobby watching
it on TV down at the dental college there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you go back to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It was the following Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be the 25th, wouldn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir; I believe so&mdash;the 25th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, one day you found a clipboard, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes; it was about a week later. I went upstairs, you see, the
corner I found it in&mdash;we keep a certain teacher's edition of Catholic handbooks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I didn't quite hear that&mdash;Catholic what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. We keep our teacher's edition of Catholic "Think and Do" books.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I didn't quite hear that&mdash;Catholic what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. We keep our teacher's edition of Catholic books&mdash;separated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir; and I went up there to get a teacher's edition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. On the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what part of the sixth floor is this Catholic edition located?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It was in that corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And in what corner is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Let's <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Without saying north or south, was it near the elevator? Or the
stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, it was right in front of the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was it with reference to the stairway?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It was right next to the stairway&mdash;right in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right in the corner next to the stairway, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what day did you find it, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I couldn't tell you. It was about a week or a week and a half,
somewhere in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this statement you gave to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
on the 2d of December 1963, says you talked to an agent named
Pinkston; do you remember that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Well, I got my boss and the FBI to go upstairs and I showed it
to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you saw the <span class="locked">clipboard&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I went downstairs and got my boss.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. William H. Shelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then what happened?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. This FBI was standing there with me&mdash;he was standing there
then and I told him I had a clipboard laying up there with the orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you think it would have been around December 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I couldn't tell you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was within a week after you went back to work, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. To my best knowledge&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;somewhere in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to find the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I was over there looking for the Catholic edition&mdash;teacher's
edition.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It was just laying there in the plain open&mdash;and just the plain
open boxes&mdash;you see, we've got a pretty good space back there and I just
noticed it laying over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Laying on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, it was laying on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It was on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How close was it to the wall?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It was about&mdash;oh&mdash;I would say, just guessing, about 5 or 6
inches, something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the wall and on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Laying on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were there any boxes between the wall and the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. No, not between the wall and the clipboard&mdash;there wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there boxes between the stairway and the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. No, you see, here's&mdash;let me see just a second&mdash;here's the stairs
right here, and we went down this way and here's the stairs this way going
up and here's the&mdash;and it was laying right in here by the cards&mdash;there are
about four or five cards, I guess, running in front of it&mdash;just laying between the
part you go down and the part you go up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean laying between the stairway up and the stairway down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, right there in the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine that clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I didn't touch it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you later touch it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir; they got me to look at it later on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see it had some orders on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were the orders dated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were they dated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I couldn't tell you, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Take a look at this statement which you gave to Mr. Pinkston that
day and read it to yourself and see if it refreshes your memory in any way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. (Read statement referred to.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you read that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does that refresh your memory now as to the orders on the clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I didn't know the date on the orders&mdash;I knew that there was
some orders on there&mdash;I seen the orders on the clipboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you examine them to determine the date on them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Did I examine those orders? No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't examine the orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. No, sir; I just went down and got my boss and then they took
it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you make any notes of the orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I didn't, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of either the names on the orders or the date of the orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. No, sir; now, my boss may have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all. Did you fill the orders, then, yourself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. No, sir; not them, I didn't.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You turned these over to your boss?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. You see, I went down and got them and they went down and
got them and they handled them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all, Mr. Kaiser, and thanks very much for coming up.</p>

<p>This will be written up and you can come down and read it over and sign
it if you wish, or you can waive your signature, if you want to, and we can send
it on without a signature.</p>

<p>Now, we will mark these pictures we've been talking about here in your
deposition as Kaiser Exhibits Nos. A, B, C.</p>

<p>(Marked by reporter as Kaiser Exhibits Nos. A, B, C, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Anything else I can do, let me know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to waive your signature to it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, I'll waive it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fine. That's okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. All right.</p>

<p>The testimony of Frankie Kaiser was taken at 3:40 p.m., on April 8, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. Joseph A. Ball, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Frankie, we have already taken your deposition and I just wanted
to ask you a few more questions and you are still under oath.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Frankie, that clipboard you found describe it&mdash;what was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It was made out of paper and tape and a little piece of pasteboard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who made it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Well, right after I started there&mdash;it had been a long time ago.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how was it you weren't using it on this day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. You see, when he first started <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is "he"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Lee&mdash;when he first started to work there he got my clipboard
and started using it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you give it to him to use?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. No, he just picked it up and started using it and I just went and
made me another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You recognized that clipboard when you saw it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, because my name was all over it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your name was on it, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You put your name "Frankie Kaiser" on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. You see, it don't do no good to get a clipboard around here&mdash;everybody
is always running off with it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the reason you put your name on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. He come up and got it and started using it and I just let him
keep it and made me another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, here is a picture which is marked in a group of pictures as
No. 36, but which I will mark as Exhibit A to your deposition.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as Kaiser Exhibit A, for identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does this show the place where the clipboard was found, or do you
know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It wasn't found there&mdash;it was found on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Behind these cartons&mdash;between there and the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Behind which cartons?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Right in here (indicating).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which cartons&mdash;it was found behind&mdash;are the cartons in the picture&mdash;it
wasn't found where it is circled there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It wasn't found where it circled&mdash;there&mdash;it was found on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Put a big "X" on the carton behind which it was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I'll put it on this one&mdash;it was found between that and the wall.
(Witness placed "X" on the pictures requested by Counsel Ball.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have marked an "X" on the carton&mdash;between that carton and
the wall the clipboard was found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, between these row of cartons right over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you later find clothing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. I just found the coat there&mdash;I didn't even know it was his until
somebody told me it was. I thought they were kidding.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Commission Exhibit 163&mdash;do you recognize that blue
jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. That's the one I found.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you find it&mdash;tell me first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. It was in the window sill.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In what room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. In the domino room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I show you a picture, No. 17, this is marked&mdash;does this
show the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Right down in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is a jacket showing in that window, is that where the
jacket was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes, sir; but it was laying behind this in the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It wasn't found in the position of the jacket shown in the picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. No; it sure wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But was it the same window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the window sill is shown there too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Yes; it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I show you a picture which is marked Exhibit 18, does this show
the place where the jacket was found?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Right over in here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where&mdash;put an "X" there&mdash;it's in the window sill?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. Right.</p>

<p>(Marked diagram with an "X".)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is an Exhibit 17, which shows the corner of the domino room
and the window and it is marked as Exhibit B and the picture marked No. 18,
which shows the window sill, bearing an "X" placed there by the witness, and
is marked as Exhibit "C". Will you initial that "C" please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. (Initialed instrument as requested.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's "FK".</p>

<p>I believe we are through, now, Frankie, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Kaiser</span>. That's all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You'll waive this signature too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you born, Mr. Givens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Kemp, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you lived in Texas most of your life?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. All my life except I was in the Armed Forces during World
War II, in the Navy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long were you in the Navy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. About 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me backtrack a little. Did you go to high school before
you went in the Navy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you get through school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Twelfth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got up to the 12th grade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I went to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Doing what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. SMU.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. SMU.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. SMU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do out there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I worked in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Oh, about 2 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I went in the service.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went in the service for a couple of years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do with most of your time in the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I was in the Steward Mate Branch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you honorably discharged?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do when you got out of the service?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I went back to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At SMU?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I worked at Central Lumber Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Doing what there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I was a truck helper; helper on the truck.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were helper on a truck?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Delivering lumber; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Oh, about a year and a half, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. One time I got into a little difficulty. Got in a little trouble.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got in a little trouble?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you were not working for a while?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how long was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. About 13 months.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I came back and I worked for a construction company, and
then after that I got this job down here at the depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At the School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long have you worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Off and on about 6 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there any period of time that you haven't worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I just, you know, sometimes I had some days to layoff during
the slack season, like it is now, and when it is rush season he calls you back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So it was just a question of being laid off during the slack season?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you do down there at the Texas Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I filled orders and stacked books, and you know, don't have
any special job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what floors do you generally work most of all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I work on the first floor most of the time, like we fill orders.
We work out of the stock downstairs. We go upstairs. We have stock on three
floors, fifth, sixth, and seventh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, do you fill orders for any particular publisher more than
another, so that you might be on the fifth floor, or the sixth floor more than the
seventh, or do you just spend as much time on any one of those top floors as you
do on any other top floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that what you were doing on the 22d of November 1963, also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What were you doing on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. We were fixing the floor, putting down some plywood on the floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What floor would this have been on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Sixth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What part of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. We were working on the west end.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, do you remember what time you got to work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes; I got to work around about a quarter to eight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go when you got to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I went in a little lunchroom that we have downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that what you call the domino room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You carry your lunch with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You put your lunch there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you wear a jacket to work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I wore a raincoat, I believe. It was misting that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hang up your coat in that room, too?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you know Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I knew of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever talked with him at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I talked to him once in a while. I mean, just like about
filling orders or something like that. Sometimes I check and he was filling orders
and he make a mistake, and I call him and get the book right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember any conversation you ever had with him? What
you said and what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, he was a fellow that kept pretty much to himself. He
never had too much to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever say anything to you, what a nice day, or about his
family, or baseball, or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Ever talk to you about any politics?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you talked to him about correcting an order, what did you
say and what did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I just tell him he had the wrong book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What would he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. He said, "Okay," and got the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you call him, Lee or Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Called him Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he call you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, he never called me anything. I never heard him call me
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he make mistakes often?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, not too often.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got to work on the morning of November 22, did you
see him at all there or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. 22d? That was on Friday, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Friday; that is the day the President came by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, I saw him that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you see him first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I first saw him on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, about 8:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, let me ask you this. You got to work at a quarter to 8?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do between a quarter of 8 and 8:30? Where were
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I went upstairs. We went to work at 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him come into the domino room at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Not that morning, no, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you leave the domino room to go up to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you don't feel he came in the domino room before 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; not that morning he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you get up to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. On the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The east or the west one? The west one is the one that would
be nearest the railroad tracks, and the east one would be nearer the Houston
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. We went up on the east one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any particular reason why you took the east one rather than
the west one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I don't know whether you call it a particular reason, but
on the west, you have double gates on that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the west elevator on the first floor when you took the east
elevator up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. It was that morning, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was that morning around 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, where did you see him at 8:30 o'clock first?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I came back down to use the rest room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. He was over there in the bin filling orders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was over in the bin filling orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir; they had some bins there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to him at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you say hello, Lee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; I didn't say anything to him. I just looked at him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what he was wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I believe it was kind of a greenish looking shirt and pants
was about the same color as his shirt, practically the same thing he wore all
the time he worked there. He never changed clothes the whole time he worked
there, and he would wear a grey looking jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You saw him at 8:30 on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, we went back upstairs and started to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went back up to the sixth floor to continue laying the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you see Lee Harvey Oswald next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Next?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, it was about a quarter till 12, we were on our way downstairs,
and we passed him, and he was standing at the gate on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>I came downstairs, and I discovered I left my cigarettes in my jacket pocket
upstairs, and I took the elevator back upstairs to get my jacket with my cigarettes
in it. When I got back upstairs, he was on the sixth floor in that
vicinity, coming from that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Coming from what way?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Toward the window up front where the shots were fired from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Just a second, where did you go? Where were you when you
saw him on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I had went and got my jacket and was on my way back to the
elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, just a second. I am going to get a plan of the sixth
floor, if I have one, and try and have you point that out to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I don't seem to have a sixth floor plan here, but perhaps
we can use another plan here to help us.</p>

<p>Here is a diagram of the front of the building. This is the Elm Street side,
and you can see the arrow pointing north.</p>

<p>This perhaps would be a diagram of the third floor. You notice that there
are one, two, three, four, five, six, seven sets of windows, right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the Elm Street side, seven pairs of windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You notice the two freight elevators toward the rear. Now did
you see&mdash;when you first saw him on the sixth floor there, were you standing
near any of these windows?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir. I was over here by the elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are pointing your finger to a spot which would be somewhat
to the east of the east elevator, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At a spot which is about on the same line as what I call the south
side of the east elevator, and about as far east of the front part of that elevator
as the distance from the front of the elevator to the back of the east elevator, is
that about right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were standing at that point, and where did you see Lee
Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I was along here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you are pointing at a spot you say along in here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be near the east wall of the building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can see a scale here that is from 0 to 20 feet. Well, it would
be about 30 to 40 feet north of the south wall of that building, is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And around 10 feet or so away from the east wall, is that about
right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. That is about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, did you notice whether or not there were any cartons
stacked up around the southeast corner of that sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I didn't pay any attention about any being stacked, because
we had taken all that stock from that side of the building and ran it down
that side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had taken stock down from the west part of the sixth floor
where you were working and put it there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes; ran it down the side right in front of the window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he between that stock and the window, or was he on the
other side of the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. He was between the stock and the window, coming towards the
elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Coming towards the elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see all of his body or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir; he had his clipboard in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He had his clipboard in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that kind of an aisleway over there right next to the east
wall that he was walking along, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir; they have aisles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, was there stock in back of him as well as in front of him?
Were you where you had stacked it up, or not, or don't you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, it was already some books stacked there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there books stacked between where you saw him and the
window itself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, he was walking with his clipboard from that southeast
corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you see him walking? What direction did you see
him walking in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. He was coming towards the elevators.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the Elm Street side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So that would be walking in a northerly direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you said that he had a clipboard in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes; he had his board with his orders on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the orders on the board?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, yes, sir; he had it in his hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he have any books in his hand that he was carrying?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever fill orders in November on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether or not there were any books or book
cartons over in that corner from which he might have been filling orders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, yes, sir; it was possible.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was possible?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you watch where he walked to?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, no, sir; I didn't pay much attention. I was getting ready
to get on the elevator, and I say, "Boy, are you going downstairs?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did he say to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I say, "It's near lunch time."</p>

<p>He said, "No, sir. When you get downstairs, close the gate to the elevator."</p>

<p>That meant the elevator on the west side, you can pull both gates down and
it will come up by itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What else did he say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. That is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you say to that? Did you say you would close the
elevator gate, or not say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I said, "Okay," and got on the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What elevator did you take down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I taken this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The east elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. The east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not when you got down to the first
floor, the west elevator was there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; it wasn't, because I looked over there to close the gate
and it wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It wasn't there when you got down to the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; it wasn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know where it was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What time was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I would say it was about 5 minutes to 12, then because it
<span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now what did you do when you got down there on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. When I got down to the first floor Harold Norman, James Jarman
and myself, we stood over by the window, and then we said we was going
outside and watch the parade, so we walked out and we stood there a while,
and then I said, "I believe I will walk up to the parking lot."</p>

<p>I had a friend that worked on the parking lot, right on Elm and Record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Elm and Record Streets?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Elm and Record Streets; yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be one block to the east of the corner of Elm and
Houston?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then, what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I stood around over there and went up on the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Up on Main and Record. That is where I watched the President
pass right there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who else was there with you that you knew?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. James and Edward Shields.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that the same person, James Edward?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Edward Shields and James.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Two other people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You watched the motorcade together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do after you watched the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. We turned and started back down to the parking lot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Then when we heard the shots, by the time we got along in
front, right across in front of the Record Building, then we heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to backtrack a minute before we come to the shots. When
did you eat lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. When did I eat lunch? I ate lunch after. Let's see, no; I ate
lunch before I went up there, because I stood outside and ate my sandwich
standing out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You ate your lunch outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir. Standing in front of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In front of what building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Texas School Book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever eat any lunch inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir; I eat inside the building all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On November 22, did you eat inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you said you saw Lee Oswald on the sixth floor around
11:55?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see Lee Oswald anywhere else in the building between
11:55 and the time you left the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him in the domino room at all around anywhere between
11:30 and 12 or 12:30?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him reading the newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No; not that day. I did&mdash;he generally sit in there every morning.
He would come to work and sit in there and read the paper, the next
day paper, like if the day was Tuesday, he would read Monday's paper in the
morning when he would come to work, but he didn't that morning because he
didn't go in the domino room that morning. I didn't see him in the domino
room that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How do you know it was the previous day paper that he read?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Because he would be sitting there and I would look at him, when
he got through and got up to go to work, I would get it and look at it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it be a News or Times Herald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, they bring Dallas Morning News around in the morning.
Fellows bring it to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean he would read someone else's newspaper that somebody
else brought to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever know him to buy his own newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; I never saw him buy one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who generally brought the newspaper there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, Harold Norman would generally bring one and James
Jarman would generally bring one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you say you left the sixth floor. Well, you said you left
it first to go&mdash;did you go down with the other employees on the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time was that now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. That was about a quarter&mdash;I said about a quarter to 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was on that elevator, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. That was Bonnie Ray Williams, and Billy Lovelady, and Danny
and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That was Danny Arce?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes; a Spanish boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you say you got down there and you say you wanted your
cigarettes so you went back up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What elevator did you go down on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I came down on the east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What elevator did you take back up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. The east elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That day had you eaten any chicken at all, or anything on the
sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you eaten any chicken or left a pop bottle on any previous
days on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go immediately to your jacket when you went back up
to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir; I went straight and picked up my jacket.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was your jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. It was on the west side of the building where we were working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, there are seven pairs of windows. Was it on the south
wall of the building? Was it near any one of those windows on the south
wall, or was it more to the center of the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. It was more to the corner on the west side. I would say along
about the second window going.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say the corner, do you mean the corner by the stairs
or the southwest corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Southwest corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have shown the southwest corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir; along about here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have pointed to a spot which appears to be approximately,
oh, 25 feet north, and about 10 feet east of the southwest corner of the sixth
floor. Would that be about right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have pointed to a spot on this floor plan here. When you
walked from the east elevator to pick up your jacket, did you see Lee Oswald
there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him anywhere on the sixth floor when you were
walking off the elevator to pick up your jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; I didn't see him until I got back along here, about in
front of the elevator, fixing to get on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you were walking to the first spot, which we will describe as
somewhat east of the east elevator, were you standing or about to get on the
elevator, or what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes; I was fixing to get on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were fixing to get on? The elevator was still there where
you left it when you came up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you were starting to get on the elevator or were turning to
get on it, you saw Lee Oswald walking with his clipboard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, was he walking in a diagonal direction directly toward
you and the elevator, or was he walking more in a direction parallel to the
east wall here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I would say yes, sir; he was going like this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Coming down the aisle.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Coming down the aisle straight?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else in his hand other than a clipboard? Did he have
a pencil in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; I didn't pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got off the elevator, as you were coming back up to
get your shirt, did you have any occasion as you were walking out of the elevator
to look to see if there was anyone else on the floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, no, sir; I wasn't thinking of that. I just happened to glance
around as I was on my way back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you glance around when you got off the elevator, do you
remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, no, sir. I just walked off and turned and went right over
there and picked my jacket up and started back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you look over in the southeast corner before as you were
getting off the elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I kind of glanced that way when I turned to go around
the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone over there at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Not at that time, no, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember how high the books were by the southeast
corner on the sixth floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I would say about 10 feet from the window. In the aisle
we had one pretty good stack of books there, one large stack.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would they have been as tall as you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If a man would have been standing up there, would you have been
able to see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; I wouldn't unless he moved down towards the north end
of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone else use any of the elevators while you were up on
the sixth floor getting your cigarettes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Not that I know of; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever tell anyone that you saw Lee Oswald reading a newspaper
in the domino room around 11:50, 10 minutes to 12 on that morning on
November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever observe Lee Oswald getting the newspaper in the
domino room shortly before lunch on days other than November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Not before lunch. It would be right at lunch time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Right at lunch time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir. We always ate in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would Oswald always eat in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you first went downstairs from the sixth floor to the first
floor with the other men on those two elevators, you took two elevators, didn't
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes; we took two down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you racing the elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who won?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, the east elevator beat the other one down, because it
stopped quicker, but it had to adjust itself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got down to the first floor before
you went back up to the sixth floor again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, I got a drink of water and reached for my cigarettes and
I thought about I left them in my jacket pocket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to the rest room at all before you went back up to
the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir. Yes, sir, I believe I did. I went in and washed my
hands, I sure did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else before you went back up to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; that was it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now the first time when you left the sixth floor with these other
men to take the two elevators down, did you at any time look over to the southeast
corner of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, no, sir; I didn't pay any attention the first time I was
coming down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you laying the new floor that morning? What portion
of the sixth floor would it be?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. West side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How much of the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, we were working, I would say, about 10 feet from Elm
Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, you were pointing to right over this point here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, looking at the scale, it would be about 10 feet from the&mdash;it
would be more than 10 feet. Here is the scale.</p>

<p>This would be 20 feet, so it would be more than 20 feet from Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. About 20 feet, maybe so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you think it was closer to 10 feet than 20 feet from the Elm
Street side of the west part of the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I believe it was somewhere in that vicinity.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How close was it to the west wall on the sixth floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, we were, oh, I would say about 20 feet out from the wall,
we had laid.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did anyone else ever comment to you as having seen Oswald on
the sixth floor that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, is there anything else you can think of that
happened that morning up to the time you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir. Everything was all right until that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you heard them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, we broke and ran down that way, and by the time we got to
the corner down there of Houston and Elm, everybody was running, going
toward the underpass over there by the railroad tracks.</p>

<p>And we asked&mdash;I asked someone&mdash;some white fellow there, "What happened?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Somebody shot the President." Like that. So I stood there
for a while, and I went over to try to get to the building after they found out
the shots came from there, and when I went over to try to get back in the
officer at the door would't let me in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you tell him you worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes; but he still wouldn't let me in. He told me he wouldn't
let no one in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This was the front of Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes. So I goes back over to the parking lot and I wait until I
seen Junior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that Jarman?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes. They were on their way home, and they told me that they
let them all go home for the evening, and I said, "I'd better go back and get my
hat and coat."</p>

<p>So I started over there to pick up my hat and coat, and Officer Dawson saw
me and he called me and asked me was my name Charles Givens, and I said,
"Yes."</p>

<p>And he said, "We want you to go downtown and make a statement."</p>

<p>And he puts me in the car and takes me down to the city hall and I made
a statement to Will Fritz down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see Lee Oswald at any time after the time you saw
him carrying the clipboard on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir. The next time I saw him was on television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else you can think of, whether I have asked
it or not, that in any way is relevant to the assassination?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of about Lee Oswald, whether I have
asked it or not, that might in any way be helpful?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir. Other than he is just a peculiar fellow. He is just a
loner. Don't have much to say to anybody. Stayed by himself most of the
time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever notice any one person there he was more friendly
with than the other?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Well, this boy he rode with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Frazier?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir. Every once in a while I would see him talking to him.
Bonnie Ray told me&mdash;I never saw him, but Bonnie Ray told me he talked to
he and Danny sometimes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Not that I know of; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir; that is about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, Mr. Givens, we surely appreciate your cooperation in
coming down here.</p>

<p>Now you and I didn't talk about this at all until we started taking this deposition,
did we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You walked into the room and you raised your right hand and we
started taking your testimony. Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have I ever met you before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. I don't believe so.
I don't believe I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have an opportunity to come back here and read this and
sign it if you want, or else you can just waive signing and have the court
reporter send it directly to Washington. Do you want to come back and read
and sign it or do you want to just have the court reporter just send it to
Washington?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Would it be necessary to come back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir; it is not. You can waive it if you desire to do it.
Do you want to waive it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Givens</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, thank you. We will see you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I was born in 1907. That would be 57, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you born in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You go to school at all in Texas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well; I had to come out of school and go to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You started working then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you started working? Where did you
work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. On the farm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the farm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. On the farm, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay on the farm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Oh, I stayed on the farm until way up after I got grown. I was
way up past&mdash;I guess I was about 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you left the the farm, then what did you do when you left
the farm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I came to town after I left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; little town at Mexia, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay in town there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I lived there for about 7 years, I guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were in town for 7 years, and generally what did you do
when you were in town?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I worked the express all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. For any particular company?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I was trying to think of the man's name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You can't remember it right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I just can't remember it right now. Been quite a little while.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, do you remember what you did after you got through
doing that? After 6 or 7 years, then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I came to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do in Dallas, generally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I worked around just different places until I started to
work for the company where I am now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you start working for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I have been with them now about 16 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have been with them 16 or 17 years? What company is
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you still working for them now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you do for the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I am a mail wrapper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are a mail wrapper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I wrap mail all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you doing that on November 22d of 1963, too? Were you
a mail wrapper at that time back in last November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to work on November 22, 1963? That was a Friday,
the day the President was assassinated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes; I went to work that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What time did you get to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, we always got to work&mdash;we were supposed to be there at
8 in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got there at 8 that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes. I always, most of the time I got there a little early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what time you got to work that particular
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. It was about 10 minutes to 8. I always be 5 or 10 minutes early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go when you got to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, when I first got to work I always made coffee in the morning
at the store. That is the first thing I do in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you make the coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you make coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, it is down on the first floor in the same department where
I wrap mail at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I have a first floor map here of the School Book Depository.
Here is Elm Street and here is the front entrance.</p>

<p>Here is Mr. Truly's office, and here is Mr. Shelley's office.</p>

<p>There is the stairway down to the basement, and there are the elevators
and the back stairway. There are the toilets there. About where would you
wrap mail there? Here is the domino room and the shower.</p>

<p>You are looking here, that is north Elm Street runs this way and Houston
Street runs that way. It is shown on that diagram.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, my place was in the west side of the other building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it near the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No; it wasn't close to the stairway.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it closer to the Elm Street side of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was it close to? The west side is the side near the railroad
tracks and the triple underpass. Is that what you think is the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir; that is what I would call the west side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, now, the northwest part is by the stairway, and the southwest
part would be toward the corner near Elm Street. Do you mean toward
the Elm or more toward the wooden dock in the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, it was about, I would say, middleways between Elm and
the dock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, there are a couple of overhead doors on that west side,
aren't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You see where it is marked on the first floor diagram, overhead
door and overhead door? Two doorways here on the west side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then was it near either one of those doorways?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, it was near this one, pretty close to this one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was close to what I would call a doorway, approximately in
the middle side of the west wall of the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is where you wrapped the mail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is where you have the coffee machine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir; I have it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is where you went when you got to work that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you first go to the domino room and leave your lunch or
hang up your coat or anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir. I just always go right there first. Sometime I pull my
coat off and lay it over on the table and go right on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long did you stay about making coffee when you got there?
How long did you stay around that place when you first got there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, let's see, it didn't take me too long. I mean, you know,
to make the coffee. After I got it made, I went right on and went right on at
my work wrapping mail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you stay in that general area all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you stay in that general location all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. That was my, all my work was right there on the first floor. I
never did&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see Lee Harvey Oswald that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes; I had been seeing him every morning, you know. He would
come to work. Excepting the morning, I didn't see him that morning at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you generally see him when he first came to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Most of the time I see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you see him when he first came to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, he would come in and probably I would be on my way back
to the rest room, probably to get water in my percolator, or maybe wash the
cups or something, and I would see him when he would come in, and I would
speak and go right ahead.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you say, and what did Lee Harvey Oswald say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I would just say to him, "Good morning," and he said, "Good
morning," to me, and he was going right on, and I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever stop and get a cup of coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I never did see him stop and get any. I don't know whether he
drink coffee or not. He never did stop and get any.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you would see him, where would he be walking or working
when he first came to work in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. He would be order filler, and naturally, they have bins, all those
bins down there made for stock, and he would be working around in there
sometime.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him when you walked into work, or did you see him
after he started working?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I would notice him times after he done started working.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't generally see him walking into work, did you, or did
you?</p>

<p>Generally, when you would first see him, would he be just walking into work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Be just coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What route would he take when he normally came to work? Do
you know what doorway? Did he walk through the front or the back?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, it is through the back door. He would come in the side door
next to the dock on the northeast side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what route would he take when he walked in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, he would come right in, and a lot of times I would be mostly,
or be passing him, and he would come right in and probably I'd go right on,
and I never would see him no more than that he would be on that work, or
whatever.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he came in, for instance, did he go right to an elevator to
go upstairs, or did he go over to the domino room, or down to the basement, or
where would he go when he would first come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. He would go and pull off his jacket or coat or whatever he had on,
and go on to work there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, where would he put his coat when he took it off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Sometimes he would hang it up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Pretty close to the elevator, or something, or lots of times he
would just lay it down on something there in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see him take his jacket into the domino room to hang
it up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No; I never did see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He would either lay his jacket or hang it up by the elevator, or
lay it on these boxes where he was working, is that what your testimony is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir; he would lay it either close, hang it up on the elevator,
or either lay it down.</p>

<p>A lot of times, he would just pull it off and lay it down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would he ever take his shirt off and put it down there and just
work in a T-shirt?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I don't believe I ever seen him working in just a T-shirt. He
worked in his shirt all right, but I never did see him work in a T-shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see him carrying his lunch inside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I never did see him with any lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On the morning of November 22, did you happen to see Buell
Wesley Frazier? Do you remember Frazier who worked down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you happen to see him come in that morning on November 22,
that Friday, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, lots of times I seen him that day, but now I didn't see him
when he came in, because I had got busy at working and I might have probably
had been in, you know, a good while before I saw him. I didn't see when he
came.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I believe you earlier testified you never saw Oswald on
November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I didn't see him that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you generally at your spot in the west part of the first floor
there that you are talking about by the mailing place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were there many days when you would ever see him working
down there in the morning near you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir. I had generally been seeing him nearly every morning,
excepting that morning I didn't see him at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw him every morning except that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Practically every morning except then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you quit for lunch that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, we always quit at 12 o'clock in the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that when you quit on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I went in and washed my hands and face and then got
ready to put my coffee on. I always make coffee at 12. Make it in the morning,
and then I make it about 12, between 12 and 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do? Did you put your coffee on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the west part of the first floor where you generally work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I went to get my lunch to eat a bite.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you get your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I always kept my lunch right there close by my machine,
by my wrapping machine that I use all the time, that I always kept my lunch.
I have a little place underneath and I keep it there all the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you the only one that wraps the books for mailing, or wraps
them up for mailing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, no, sir; I am not the only one, but mine is that way just every
day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You do it all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes; I do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you the only one that does it all the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I am the only one that is steady, wraps mail all the time, although
I have help, you know, when it gets stacked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Lee Harvey Oswald ever help you wrap mail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No sir; he never did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not he ever borrowed or used any wrapping
paper for himself?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see him around these wrapper rolls or wrapper
roll machines, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I never noticed him being around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are they paper machines with the rolls of wrapping paper? You
have some gum there too, for taping it? When you wrap it, would you tape it
with some tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I never noticed him being around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you do that? Did you put tape on the wrapping paper when
it was being shipped?</p>

<p>When you wrap the books up with wrapping paper, did you have any gum
tape that you put on it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I had a machine that I placed it on the machine and
tied it with, and the machine tied it with a string.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With string?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Didn't you have any gummed tape by your machine?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Sir?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you have any kind of a tape, sticky tape that you would
put on the paper to keep it together, or was that somewhere else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Oh, yes, sir; I used some of that wide tape.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that sticky tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To seal the package with?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>And then I tie it, put it on the machine and then tie it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is yours the only place that they have the sticky tape?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, that is the only place that is supposed to be, you know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could other employees come and pick up some of the tape for
themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir; they could come get it if they wanted to use it, but
all the time it was there where it is supposed to be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did other employees from time to time come and borrow some of
that tape at all, or use it?</p>

<p>Would other employees ever use any of that tape for themselves?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Not as I know of now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If I wanted to use any of that tape, you know that tape that
you use to seal it, is there a way to make tape wet so I don't have to lick it
myself with my tongue to make it wet and sticky? Or how did you get it to be
sticky and stick together?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, we have those machines with the little round ball that we
fill them up with water, and so we set them up. In to&mdash;other words, I got a
rack that we set them in, and so we put out tape in a machine, and whenever
we pull the tape through, why then the water gets, you know, it gets water on
it as we pull it through.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If I wanted to pull the tape, pull off a piece without getting
water on it, would I just lift it up without going over the wet roller and get
the tape without getting it wet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. You would have to take it out. You would have to take it out
of the machine. See, it's put on there and then run through a little clamp that
holds it down, and you pull it, well, then the water, it gets water on it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is this an electrical machine or is it just kind of a little apparatus
for just pulling it through by hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, it is not electric, no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now going back to November 22, you said you quit for lunch
around noon on that day on Friday, November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes. About 12 o'clock we always quit for lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember any of the men coming down the elevator
that day? Bonnie Ray Williams or James Jarman, Jr., or Danny Arce, or any
one else coming down that morning? Charlie Givens?</p>

<p>Do you remember them coming down the elevator, or don't you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, after you quit for lunch, you made the coffee then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you make the coffee?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I made the coffee right there close to the wrapping mail table
where I wrap mail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I sit down to eat my lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I had just, after I made coffee, I just had started to eat
my lunch because I was a little hungry&mdash;I didn't eat anything that morning
before I went to work&mdash;and I had started to eat my lunch.</p>

<p>But before I got through, well, all of this was, I mean, the police and things
was coming in, and I was just spellbound. I just didn't know what was the
matter. So I didn't get through eating. I had to eat about half my lunch,
and that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear any shots fired?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I didn't hear a one. Didn't hear a one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone else on the first floor while you were eating
your lunch? Anyone else at all did you see on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. It wasn't anybody. I didn't see anybody around at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At any time while you were making coffee or eating your lunch,
did you see anyone else on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I didn't see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was the first person you saw on the first floor after you&mdash;while
you were eating your lunch? Someone came in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes; before I got through. The officers and things were coming
in the front door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was the first person or persons that you saw coming through
there while you were eating your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, that was police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A police officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I guess it was a bunch of them, I guess, FBI men, and just a
crowd of them coming in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see Roy Truly coming in at all that time? Do you
know Mr. Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir; that is the boss, the superintendent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see him, do you remember, while you were eating
your lunch, come in the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Yes, sir; I think he came in with the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he one of the first people in, or did other people come in
ahead of him, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Really, I just don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is okay if you don't remember. That is all I want you
to say if you don't remember.</p>

<p>Did you hear anyone yelling to let the elevator loose or anything like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. I can't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you working when you were eating your lunch? Were
you facing the elevator or not when you were eating your lunch? Were
you facing any of the elevators back there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I was always&mdash;I mean I would always be with my back
kind of, you know, towards the elevators and facing the front side over on the
side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The Elm Street side?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Toward Elm Street side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you don't know whether anyone was using the elevators?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether anyone was going up and down the stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know anything else about what happened on November
22, that might be helpful or relevant here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I don't really.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you ever on the second floor on November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I never did hardly ever leave the first floor. That is
just I stayed there where all my work was, and I just stayed there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On November 22, did you ever leave the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. No, sir; I never did leave the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you can think of, whether I have asked it
or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I don't know anything else. I know of nothing else.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we thank you very much for coming down here, Mr. West.
If you want, you can come back down again and read your deposition and sign
it, or else you can just waive coming down here. You don't have to come
down. You can tell the court reporter to send it directly to us, if you want to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. You mean when I get ready to sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you do not have to sign it if you don't want to. You can
just tell the court reporter to type it up and send it directly to us, or you can
tell the court reporter you would like to read it and sign it before she sends
it to us in Washington.</p>

<p>You don't have to sign it. Or if you want to sign it, you can come back
and sign it, whichever you want to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I think&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to come down here again and read it and sign it,
or do you want to waive?</p>

<p>You can waive and tell the court reporter that she can just send it after
she types it up, directly to us in Washington without your reading it and
signing it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">West</span>. Well, I think that is what I will do, just have it waived and
send it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, that is fine.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, sir.</p>

<p>The testimony of Danny G. Arce was taken at 2:15 p.m., on April 7, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you stand up and raise your right hand?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. State your name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Danny Garcia Arce.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. 1502 Bennett Avenue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you tell me something about yourself, where you were born
and where you went to school?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I was born here in Dallas and I went to Stephen F. Foster Elementary
school and Alex W. Spence Junior High and Crozier Tech.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Well, I quit school and found a job and worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you find a job?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. The first job, well, you don't <span class="locked">want&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; just in general.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Oh, I worked as a cook, short order cook and busboy, and just odd
jobs at this Rubenstein place on Hall&mdash;Rubenstein and Sons. I haven't had too
many jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is Rubenstein and Son, a restaurant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No; kind of an oyster place; they pack them and send them out,
I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else have you done?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. That's about all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you go to work for the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I started in September&mdash;September, I believe, the 6th, September
6th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of what year?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You received a letter from the Commission asking you to appear
here, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You understand the purpose of the investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To determine the facts surrounding the assassination of the President,
President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You started to work in September 1963, this last September?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes; last September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work were you employed to do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Order filler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What building did you work in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. At the warehouse.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At Houston and Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No; that's <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which is this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. That's the one behind it; directly behind the Texas School Book
Depository at Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You worked there most of the time as an order filler?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever work over at the building at 411 Elm?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir; they were short of help up there and they sent me and the
other boy down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is the other boy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Bonnie Ray Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They sent you out to do what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Help lay out a floor on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What date did they send you down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Sir, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. October?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I know I had been there about 4 weeks when all that happened;
I believe 4 or 5 weeks. I am not too sure about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean 4 or 5 weeks before November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you laying floor at that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir; we laid floor on the fifth and then we were on the sixth
when this happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever meet a fellow named Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah, he worked with us and he didn't associate with us too much.
He was kind of quiet. He didn't like to talk too much to us or anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say he worked with you; did he work laying floors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, he was an order filler; he just worked the same place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah, quite a few times.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Ever see him on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever eat lunch with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. We all eat lunch together in this little domino room. We play
dominoes and eat our lunch. He might walk in and lay around with us and he
would walk out. He didn't stay in there too long. I guess he didn't like crowds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November, what time did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. We start at eight but I believe I was a little late.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to work on what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Sixth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you work there all morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you get off work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. That day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At noon for your lunch hour or your lunch period?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. What time we left down for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. We usually leave down about 5 to 12, something around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you go down stairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. By the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have sort of a race that day, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Well, me and Bonnie Ray and, I am not too sure, I believe it was
Billy Lovelady, were on the same elevator, and Charles Givens and the other
guys were on the other one and we were racing down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which elevator were you on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. We have two of them that go up, the same deal and I was on the
one facing east. There's an east and a west elevator and I was in the one
facing east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Lee Oswald or hear him speak on the way down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah, he was up there and I believe someone asked if he wanted
to go down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was there&mdash;on what floor?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. That's what I'm not too sure; I believe he was on five or the sixth
floor. I am not too sure but we were going down and I believe he was on the
fifth; I am not too sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. He said "You all close the door on the elevator, I will be down,"
or somethin'. I didn't pay too much attention. He said to leave the elevator
come down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him around there after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, I didn't see him around after that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. In that little domino room there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I went outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. With Billy Lovelady and Mr. Shelley and I was out there with
Junior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who is Junior?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I don't know his real name; I just know him by Junior.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Bonnie Ray Williams ever out there with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, he stayed upstairs with Hank. Junior stayed up there but
he was down a little while and I guess he went upstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Givens?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. He was down there with Shields, I guess&mdash;I mean Melvin&mdash;no,
Carl, that's who he was with.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Jack Dougherty?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. He was on all floors; I couldn't tell you where he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he outside?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, he was eating lunch; me and Jack Dougherty, same time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Dougherty ate his lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he go outdoors after lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I don't know; I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who went outdoors with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Bill Shelley and Billy Lovelady; Carl was out there and Charles
Givens.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You stood there how long before the parade came along?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I am not too sure; it was about 10 minutes, somewhere around
there. I am not too sure about that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see the President go by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah, I did. I seen him when he turned the corner and when he
went down that underpass thing and I heard them shots and I couldn't see
anything. There was a lot of people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you standing when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I was standing in front of the Texas School Book Depository. I
was on that grassy area part in front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were not on the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, I was on the sidewalk, then I walked up to the grass to get a
higher view and still couldn't see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you make out the direction of the sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah, I thought they came from the railroad tracks to the west of
the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you were on the grass, were you south where you were?
Where were you with reference to the entrance to the Texas School Book
Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I was down to the west side, a little more to the west.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you west of the building itself?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were not in front of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I was directly in front, but then I walked a few steps down to the
west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you with reference to the west wall of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Oh, I was way far from it. I was across the street, I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean "across the street"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Well, there's a little sidewalk right across the street and there's
some grass and things up there and that's where I was at. I couldn't tell you
exactly where I was, see, it's hard to explain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you say you were not in front of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Well, not directly, not in front; I was across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you west of the west wall of the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Well, I was, well the <span class="locked">building&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I understand but you were to the south of the building. You had
to be south of the building, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Well, I was south but I was, well, I guess you could say I was in
front of the building but not directly in front, well, I don't know how to
explain it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was standing with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Well, I walked away from the other guys because they were all in
front of the building and I went across the street to get a closer view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You walked which direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I just&mdash;right across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Right across Elm Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The part of Elm that dead ends there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You crossed that and went on to the grassy part?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, it sounded to you that the shots came from what direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. From the tracks on the west deal.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look back at the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, I didn't think they came from there. I just looked directly to
the railroad tracks and all the people started running up there and I just ran
along with them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go up to the railroad tracks?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, and they told us go back there and I went back inside the
building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Back inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you stay in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Oh, about 15 minutes and they took us down to city hall to make
statements out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you made out your statement?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir; to the Police Department.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, just I minute, let's <span class="locked">see&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I helped this old man, this gentleman in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw an old man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Right in front of the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Right, you know, it was before it happened; I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long before the President went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I don't know. I think it was about 10 minutes, some place around
there, 15 minutes; I'm not too sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the old man; what was noticeable about him?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Well, he said he had kidney trouble, could I direct him to the men's
room and I said I would and I helped him up the steps and walked him into the
restroom and I opened the door for him and that's when I went inside to eat
my lunch and then I seen him walk out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him talk to anyone in there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No; he went straight out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he in a car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah, after I went outside I seen him driving out in a black car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He drove away?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, never seen him again.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just I minute, I want to show you a picture. I show you Commission
Exhibit No. 369. I show you this picture. See this man in this
picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Recognize him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, that's Billy Lovelady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just to identify it clearly, the man on the steps&mdash;well, you see the
man on the steps, do you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He is a white man, isn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you see his picture just above the picture of two colored people,
is that correct; would you describe it like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I am not going to mark this purposely because other witnesses
have to see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say that is Billy Lovelady?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, that is Billy Lovelady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, there is only one face that is clearly shown within the
entrance-way of the Texas School Book Depository Building, isn't there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And only one face of a person who is standing on the steps of the
Depository Building entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that one man you see <span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes, that's Billy Lovelady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you came to work that morning, <span class="locked">Danny&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was Oswald there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I believe I seen him once that morning on the first floor, some
place around there. I'm not too sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But did you see him go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him have in his possession any paper bag or
sack that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. No, sir; I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This will be written up and you will have an opportunity to read
it and sign it if you wish or you can waive signature. Which do you wish? If
you waive signature, you don't have to come back. Which do you prefer? Do
either one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I don't understand too well.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She writes this up. Then if you wish, you can come in, read it over
and, if there are any changes to be made, you make them and you swear to it
before this young lady, who is a notary public, or you can waive signature and
we will send it on to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. I guess you all could send it on to the Commission.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you waive signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Arce</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thanks very much for coming in.</p>

<h2 id="t368"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_JOE_R_MOLINA" id="TESTIMONY_OF_JOE_R_MOLINA">TESTIMONY OF JOE R. MOLINA</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Joe R. Molina was taken at 4:50 p.m., on April 7, 1964, in the
office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel
of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you rise and raise your right hand, Mr. Molina?</p>

<p>(Witness complying.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give will
be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Joe R. Molina.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. 4306 Brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me something about yourself; where were you born?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I was born here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was your education?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, I went to Crozier Tech High School and I finished after
I came back from the service and at that time my intention was to go to college
but I got married and instead went to business college. Then later on after
attending about 5 months business college, I had to find a job because my wife
was expecting a baby, consequently, I started working on-the-job training at
the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I started working in February of 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you been working there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. 16 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. 16 years?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you wrote the Commission a letter asking to testify, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you happen to do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, I called in. I didn't know whether I was going to be
called or not and they told me, you know, that I should write a letter and ask
the Commission, you know. (Letter marked Molina Exhibit A.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You wanted to be heard, is that right, before the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have something particularly you wanted to tell us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, on November 23d following the assassination, I was
paid a visit by the local police department at 1:30 in the morning and they
sort of wanted to tie me up with this case in some way or another and they
thought that I was implicated.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What makes you think they thought you were implicated?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, they were looking for something. I don't know what it
was they were looking for in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They came to your house here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. That's right, woke up my wife and children; scared my wife
half to death.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they search the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they have a search warrant?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I don't know whether they did or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they tell you what they were looking for?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, they asked me questions whether I knew different persons
that belong to the G.I. <span class="locked">Forum&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. G.I. Forum, this club I belonged to here in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How do you spell that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. G.I. F-o-r-u-m [spelling].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. G.I. F-o-r-u-m [spelling] in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was it that asked you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, I think it was Mr. Garroway did most of the questioning
and police Lieutenant Revill, I believe&mdash;yeah, that was his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they ask you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. They asked me if I knew certain persons that had come into
the forum when it was first initiated and if I was acquainted with them and
if I associated with them, so forth and so on. I said my activities were limited
to the club. I didn't have any social, you know, I wasn't intimate with them
but merely a club that was started. I was asked by my pastor to go see about
this particular club which I did and consequently, the club met at the church
auditorium after it was founded and one of the parish priests was a chaplain.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it a Catholic, Roman Catholic organization?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. The G.I. Forum?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. No; the forum is a veterans' club.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What else happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, after the police came, they didn't know whether&mdash;they were
undecided what to do, whether they would take me in for questioning or not
and so they decided evidently, since I told them&mdash;they asked me if they could
take a look around. I said "Sure, I don't have anything to hide, look around".
They looked around and did a lot of searching and my wife started to get back
in bed. She didn't know that was going on. She thought they just want to
question me and they told her she had to get out of bed and go into the living
room and the kids were in the back room. I only have two bedrooms and the
kids were sleeping out there. They woke up the kids; they were looking in
their room, so they started questioning the kids, too. They started to ask me
questions and ask the kids about it. In other words, to corroborate our statements.
I didn't know at the time they were doing it but later on found out.
They couldn't find anything. I knew they wouldn't find anything. I didn't
know what they were looking for in the first place. They decided to bring me
down to the Dallas Police Department for questioning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down to the police department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, they asked me if I would go down the next morning and
I said yes, I would go down the next morning. I would rather go down the
next morning than now. It was already past 2, so the next morning my wife
drove me down. I got there about 11. My wife drove me down and I got there
about 10:30. The place was full of television people and reporters swarming all
over the place and they told me to wait in the room there and then I went into
Chief Gannaway's office or whatever his name is. He said I was supposed to be
questioned by Mr. Fritz down there but that he wanted to talk to me after they
questioned me up there because they wanted to know more about the G.I. Forum
so I said "I will come back when they get through questioning me." So I went
up there and they told me to wait in an office and so I waited there for about
30, 40 minutes and, oh, must have been longer than that, they finally questioned
me and they put me in a room and there was a man from the FBI or Secret
Service, I don't recall which one it was. He was sitting on my right and
there was a fellow from the Dallas Police Department taking a statement and a
fellow from the FBI introduced himself, said I'm so and so, show me his badge
and so forth. The other fellow didn't say who he was or anything, just sat
there and so then they told me to wait there in that room and I did. I was
there for about 45 minutes and then the fellow came back from the FBI, said
"My God, are you still in here?" I said "Yes," he said "How long you been
here?" Here it was about 2 or 3 o'clock. I said "I have been here since about
11; I haven't eaten lunch or haven't had a drink of water". You know, I was
just there and which he told this fellow, said "Can't you let him go; he has
been here. He has already given his testimony statement, whatever he is
going to give; you should let him go." This fellow said "No, he got to wait in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
there" so I had to go back in there; about 10 or 15 minutes later, they came
back and I went up to the office of Lieutenant Revill and he started asking
a lot of questions about the G.I. Forum, did I know such and such fellow&mdash;some
I knew, they had been in the club. Naturally, I knew them though we weren't
intimate friends, some were, some weren't. Then he gave me a bunch of names,
I imagine they were in their so-called subversive files that they claim they have;
of course, I didn't know a lot of them. In fact, I didn't know most of them. I
knew some of the names. I didn't know some of the names they mentioned are
kept in their files or not. Anyhow, they asked me&mdash;I had to&mdash;they didn't ask
me&mdash;I had to just ask to sign a statement I belonged to the forum and certain
members were charter members of the forum and I said yes, I would sign it.
I didn't see anything wrong with it so I signed it and they told me I could go
home. It was 4:30 or 5 and they asked me if I had a ride home and I said no.
They said "Well, we'll give you a ride home, so one of the officers there, plainclothes
man, drove me home. When I got home, of course, there were about
three or four cars at the house. My wife was all shook up and she said "My
God" she said "Don't you know what they been saying about you?" I said "No,
I don't know what they are saying about me." She said "Don't you know you
been on TV and the news media across the nation saying you are on the so-called
list with the Dallas Police Department claiming that you associate with
persons of"&mdash;see if I can quote it right&mdash;I was known to associate with persons
of subversive background.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was on TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who put that on TV?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. It was a statement made by Chief Curry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Chief Curry and I says "No, I didn't know anything about it.
I was just being questioned." They said "Well, did you tell them to release your
name?" I said "I don't know who gave my name out, gave out the information."
So, they were very concerned because at first, I didn't think it was&mdash;I
figured they would make a retraction and I would be cleared, so forth and so
on and nothing came out on the radio and nothing was said and I called the
Police Department and told them I wanted to talk to Chief Curry and they
said he was busy. I was talking to, I think someone, fellow named King. He
answered the phone and he said any retraction has to come from Chief Curry.
I called the Associated Press which released the statement to the news media
and they wouldn't give me any satisfaction. They told me I would have to get
in touch with some fellow in New York or something like that, so that was&mdash;I
couldn't get any satisfaction. I was accused of something I didn't know anything
about.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ever give you a retraction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. And, consequently, well, that happened on November 23d; my
boss was very upset about it. He said that the vice president of the company,
Mr. Campbell, they didn't say anything to me, they didn't come to me and
say "Joe, we will stand by you, we don't believe it." Nothing was said for
about 10 days so I went in and told them, I said, "You don't have to be afraid,
I'm going to get this thing cleared. I am going to find somebody to clear me
of this." They said "You better do it very fast because the president is very
upset about it and we have been getting a lot of calls and several people calling
in and saying he hires subversives" and so forth and so on. I saw one letter
did say that. It came to them from some fellow said he wasn't going to do
business with that book firm because they hired Communists. I knew they were
probably under pressure. Well, on December 13, they called me in and said
they wanted to talk with me and they told me that due to automation I was
going to have to be replaced. That happened in December 13, about 3 weeks
afterwards so I told them I said "I don't really think that's the reason why
you're letting me go, it's probably because of this other thing." He said "No,
we got automation here, we are taking too much business in so we have to let
you go." No news was ever given to me there was no machines for replacement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
nothing, so I said&mdash;well, I didn't leave until December 30 and got all
the routine work I had been assigned was gradually shifted to another person.
I was there doing nothing. I finally left December 30 and I have received a
letter from a friend in California saying my name was in the paper stating
that I had been labeled as a communist and I got a call from Florida, from a
good friend of mine saying they labeled me a communist and saying I was a
friend of Oswald's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. No; I had seen him there in the building. I had seen him but
never talked with him or been introduced.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where are you working now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I am working over here&mdash;that's another thing. I couldn't find
a job. Who is going to hire me? So I called this friend of mine he belonged
to the Dads Club where I go to church, Holy Trinity. His name is Mr. Redman,
vice president at Neuhoff's. I called him about a job and he said "No, I don't
have anything in your line of work." I happened to mention to him I used
to do credit union work and at that time they happened to be looking for a
man and that's the reason I found this particular job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are working at Neuhoff's Employees Credit Union?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you a bookkeeper; is that what you usually do is bookkeeping?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pursue it any further; did you file any actions of any
sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I have an attorney that is working towards something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to work what <span class="locked">date&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I went to work in February 1947.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For the Texas School Book Depository at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes; at that time they were located at 2210 Pacific.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, November 22, 1963, the place you worked was in the second
floor of this School Book Depository Building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go out on the street to see the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes; I was standing on the front steps.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Right next left of me was Mr. Williams and close to there was
Mrs. Sanders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Pauline Sanders?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Roy Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes; he was standing with Mr. Campbell; they were going out
to lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They were in front of you were they?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw the President's car pass?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anything after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, I heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where&mdash;what was the source of the sound?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Sort of like it reverberated, sort of kind of came from the west
side; that was the first impression I got. Of course, the first shot was fired
then there was an interval between the first and second longer than the second
and third.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, I just stood there, everybody was running and I didn't
know what to do actually, because what could I do. I was just shocked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes, this fellow come to me&mdash;Mr. Williams said, somebody said,
somebody was shooting at the President, somebody, I don't know who it was.
There was some shooting, you know, and this fellow said "What can anybody gain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
by that"; he just shook his head and I just stood there and shook my head. I
didn't want to think what was happening, you know, but I wanted to find out so I
went down to where the grassy slope is, you know, and I was trying to gather
pieces of conversation of the people that had been close by there and somebody
said "Well, the President has been shot and I think they shot somebody else",
something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Mr. Truly go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you saw him go into the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I was right in the entrance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a police officer with him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I didn't see a police officer. I don't recall seeing a police officer
but I did see him go inside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see a white-helmeted police officer any time there in the
entrance?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, of course, there might have been one after they secured
the building, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, I mean when Truly went in; did you see Truly actually go into
the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I saw him go in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you standing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Right at the front door; right at the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Outside the front door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes, outside the front door I was standing; the door was right
behind me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you standing on the steps?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes, on the uppermost step.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You actually saw Truly go in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yeah.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were still standing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long was it after you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Oh, I would venture to say maybe 20 or 30 seconds afterwards.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had somebody come up and said the President was shot before
you saw Truly go in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know a girl named Gloria Calvary?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Gloria come up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Yes, she came. I was in the lobby standing there and she came
in with this other girl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. She said "Oh, my God, Joe, he's been shot." They were both
horrified. I said "Are you sure he was shot?" She said "Oh, Joe, I'm sure.
I saw his hair fly up and I'm sure he was shot" something to that extent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You left the building that day about what time and went home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Oh, it must have been around, I would say, I would say it was
about 2, maybe a little before that, I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I had seen him in the building, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever speak to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. No; I never spoke to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him at all on November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I never did see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any strangers in the building on that day November 22d?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. No; like I stated before, I came in at&mdash;to work at 7 in the morning
because I had a key and I was on the second floor all the time, never did
leave except maybe to go to the restroom, something like that. Then I ate
my lunch, took my lunch and ate it and went downstairs about 12:15.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Okay, thanks very much, Mr. Molina. This will be written up
for your signature if you wish; you can come in and sign it or you can waive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
your signature, whichever you wish. If you wish to sign it, this young lady
will notify you when it is typed and you can come in, read it, and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I just wanted to state in the record that I want to deny any
accusations if there is any doubt in anybody's mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; there is nobody I ever heard has accused you of anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. I know there's a fella that I talk with that belongs to the or had
worked with the FBI that knows my position in this thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I never heard anybody accuse you of any wrongdoing in connection
with this matter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. In fact, Bill Lowery worked with the FBI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't have to worry about that; no one is accusing you of
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Except the local people here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to sign it or do you want to waive your signature;
how do you feel about it? It's your option; you can do either way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Well, I would like to.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. See it and sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. See it and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She will notify you then. She will tell you when to come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Molina</span>. Thanks very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, jobs were pretty scarce about the time I got out of
the service, so I just went from place to place and applied and put my application
in, so I started over here at the Texas School Book Depository and put my
application in there and I got it through the Suburban Employment Agency,
and I been working there ever since.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that was when&mdash;in 1940, was it, you started to work at the

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I didn't do anything to be frank with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You stayed at home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you live with your father and mother?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Oh&mdash;shipping clerk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what kind of work is that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, that's when they bring the orders from on the second
floor, and in other words, you fill them from the&mdash;they are orders, I guess you
would call them orders, to fill from there, and outside of doing little odd jobs
besides that&mdash;that's it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know a fellow named Lee Harvey Oswald that worked at the
Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I'll be frank with you, Mr. Ball, I don't believe nobody
knew him too well. You might say he wouldn't have too much to say to anybody.
He just stayed all to hisself, and I'll be frank with you, I just flat didn't
know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on November 22, 1963, that's the day the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I got there&mdash;it was after 7 o'clock in the morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you usually get there in the morning at 7 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why do you get there at 7 instead of 8, when the rest of the men
get there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, you might say, I have a little&mdash;extra chores to do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You do that&mdash;you get there at 7 all the time, don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, I've been doing it for 11 years.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's what Mr. Truly told me, that you get there real early.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you did get there about 7 that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's see, Mr. Dougherty, you said that you have some extra
chores&mdash;what are those extra chores?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I have to see to it that the water system is pumped up. In
other words, the air pressure is up to where&mdash;up to 40 pounds so that if it
isn't pumped up, the alarm goes off, and the ADT runs that alarm system, and
we immediately call Mr. Truly and of course they call me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the ADT?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's that&mdash;I don't know too much about it&mdash;it has something
to do with the alarm system they have got down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the pressure, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that a fire-alarm system?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes&mdash;you could call it that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what else do you do there early in the morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, let's see, I have to check and see that there is no
leaks in the building, that the pipes are not leaking somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Anything else you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No; I believe that just about covers it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time do you usually go to lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, usually about 12 o'clock or 12 noon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you carry your lunch most of the time from home?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where do you usually eat your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, they have got what they call a domino room in
there and I usually eat it in there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You usually eat your lunch in the domino room?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long do you take for lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, from 12 to 12:45.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Forty-five minutes?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you always take a full hour?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes; I usually do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you remember the day of November 22, 1963; you do,
don't you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The day that the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what time you went to work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes&mdash;let's see&mdash;it was 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to work that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, that particular morning&mdash;let's see, we didn't go back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; I mean, what time did you go to work the first thing in the
morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. It was 8 o'clock when we were actually started to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you get to the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. At a quarter to 7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At a quarter to 7?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told the FBI officers that you got there about 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I mean, inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes&mdash;when I got inside the building it was 7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You parked your car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I don't have a car&mdash;I have to ride the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald come to work that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes&mdash;when he first come into the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he came in the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him come in the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes; I saw him when he first come in the door&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have anything in his hands or arms?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, not that I could see of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That was 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was about 8 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What door did he come in?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, he came in the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I was&mdash;sitting on top of the wrapping table.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, do you remember that you gave a statement to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and to a man by the name of Ellington, or a Mr.
Anderton, the day after&mdash;the 23d of November?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes&mdash;I talked to so many of them&mdash;it is kind of hard to
remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And there is a statement that they took when they talked to you
and in it you said, "I recall vaguely, having seen Lee Oswald, when he came
to work at about 8 a.m. today."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I did&mdash;that morning.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That seems to be dated the 22d day of November 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The full statement is, "I am employed by the Texas School Book
Depository, 411 Elm Street, Dallas, as an order filler, and reside at 1827 South
Marsalis Street, Dallas, Tex."</p>

<p>Did you tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. "I started to work today, 11-22-63, at about 7 a.m. o'clock."</p>

<p>Did you tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The statement says, "I recall vaguely having seen Lee Oswald,
when he came to work at about 8 a.m. today."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, is that a very definite impression that you saw him that
morning when he came to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, oh&mdash;it's like this&mdash;I'll try to explain it to you this way&mdash;you
see, I was sitting on the wrapping table and when he came in the door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
I just caught him out of the corner of my eye&mdash;that's the reason why I said it
that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he come in with anybody?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was alone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes; he was alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recall him having anything in his hand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I didn't see anything, if he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pay enough attention to him, you think, that you would
remember whether he did or didn't?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I believe I can&mdash;yes, sir&mdash;I'll put it this way; I didn't
see anything in his hands at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, your memory is definite on that, is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, you would say positively he had nothing in his
hands?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I would say that&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or, are you guessing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw him come in the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The back door on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. It was in the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, that back door is the door that opens onto what? That back
door would be the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it opens where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. On the back dock&mdash;on the back dock side over there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That would be what direction from the first floor&mdash;what wall of
the first floor&mdash;north?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, let's see, to be frank with you&mdash;I don't know which
one it would be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there only one back door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes; there is only one back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him again that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes; just one more time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That was on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. It was about 11 o'clock&mdash;that was the last time I saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he doing up there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, as far as I could tell, he was getting some stock&mdash;as
far as I could tell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were you doing there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I was getting some stock also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were there some other workmen up there at the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Not that I know of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, do you remember Shelley, Dan Arce, Bonnie Williams, Bill
Lovelady, and Charlie Givens who were working up there that morning&mdash;laying
floor on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Oh, yes; they were laying floor&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were they there at the time you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Oh, yes, sir; they were there&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the same time you saw Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir; just about that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And how long were you on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, just long enough to get some stock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I went to the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I went to the fifth floor to get some stock also on the
fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Then, just about that time&mdash;I thought I <span class="locked">heard&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wait a minute&mdash;did you go to lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I went back downstairs to eat lunch&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Oh, it was 12 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you talked to the FBI men, I've got a statement here dated
the 19th of December 1963, a statement from Special Agent William O. Johnson,
and he reports that you told him that you saw Lee Harvey Oswald at approximately
8 a.m. when he, Oswald, arrived.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That you saw Oswald again at approximately 11 a.m. on the sixth
floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But you didn't see him again after that, is that your testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the truth?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it also says, this report from Mr. Johnson, states that you told
him that just prior to 12 noon you and five other men were working on the sixth
floor. Were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes; we were working on the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What were you doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I was getting some stock off of the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You weren't helping the men lay floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down to lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. The first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well&mdash;used the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go down alone or with someone?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I went down alone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you eat your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. In the domino room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what time did you go back to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Oh, at 12:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know that the President was going to pass in a motorcade
that noon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, they said something about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you intend to go out and watch him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I would have loved to have went out and watched him
but the steps were so crowded&mdash;there was no way in the world I could get out
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you take a look at it&mdash;did you go out and take a look at it, or
didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you were on the first floor in the domino room when you
finished your lunch, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you stay there any length of time after you finished your
lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir&mdash;just a short length of time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, then, I went back to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Let me see&mdash;oh, up to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Oh, it was about 12:40&mdash;it was about 12:40.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you heard any shots before that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes&mdash;I heard one&mdash;it sounded like a backfire.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when you heard that shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I was on the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when you left your lunch, did you go to the fifth floor or the
sixth floor to go back to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I went on the fifth floor when I was getting ready to go
down to eat lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; and then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, at that time&mdash;I was about 10 feet <span class="locked">away&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Wait a minute&mdash;did you hear the shots before or after you had your
lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Before&mdash;before I ate my lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard shots before you ate your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Let's see&mdash;yes, I believe I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, now, you remember having your lunch, do you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember after you had your lunch, you went back to work
that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you talked on the day this accident happened, on the 22d of
November 1963, in a statement made to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
and, Mr. Dougherty, you told them you went down to the first floor to eat your
lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that you went back to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you told him on the 19th day of December, Mr. Johnson, that
you went back to work on the sixth floor, and as soon as you arrived on the
sixth floor, you went down to the fifth floor to get some stock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And while you were on the fifth floor, you heard a loud noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right&mdash;it sounded like a car backfiring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you hear more than one loud explosion or noise?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No; that was the only one I heard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You only heard one?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where did it sound like it came from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. It sounded like it came from overhead somewhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From overhead?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you get to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were on the fifth floor when you heard this, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which elevator did you take?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, you see, there's one on this side and one on this side&mdash;the
one on this side is the one I took.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, now, "The one on this side and the one on this side," doesn't
mean much when it's written down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I know it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me whether it was the east side or the west side
elevator?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. East side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is it the one that you punch a button on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or the one that you use a control on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. It's the one you push a button on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The one you push a button on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I believe that is the west side, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, I believe it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, that's the one you took up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you take that&mdash;to what floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I took it up to the sixth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, when I got through getting stock off of the sixth floor,
I came back down to the fifth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I got some stock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, then immediately I heard a loud noise&mdash;it sounded
like a car backfiring, and I came back down to the first floor, and I asked Eddie
Piper, I said, "Piper, what was that?" I says, "Has the President been shot?"
He said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't say&mdash;did you say, "Has the President been shot?"&mdash;you
told the FBI agent that you went down to the first floor and you saw a man
named Eddie Piper and asked him if he heard a loud noise.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I asked him that too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Piper said he had heard three loud noises and told you that
somebody had just shot the President; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who mentioned the fact that the President had been shot first&mdash;you
or Eddie Piper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Eddie Piper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say anything to Piper about the President being shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you talked to Eddie Piper, did you know that the President
had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir; I didn't know that at the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When is the first time you heard that the President had been shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. When Eddie told me that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Eddie told you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told Mr. Johnson of the Federal Bureau of Investigation
that when you were on the fifth floor, you heard a loud noise and it appeared
to have come from within the building, but you couldn't tell where&mdash;you told him
that on the 19th; did you tell him that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the day that this happened, on the 22d of November, you told the
FBI agents Ellington and Anderton that you heard "a loud explosion which
sounded like a rifle shot coming from the next floor above me."</p>

<p>Now, did you tell them that it sounded like a rifle shot, coming from the next
floor above you, or didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well; I believe I told them it sounded like a car backfiring.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did you tell them it sounded like it was from the floor
above you, or didn't you tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did not tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did it sound like it came from the floor above you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, at the time it did&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me this&mdash;when you heard that explosion or whatever it was&mdash;that
loud noise, where were you on the fifth floor&mdash;tell me exactly where you
were?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I was about 10 feet from the west elevator&mdash;the west
side of the elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's the elevator that uses the push button; is that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what were you doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I was getting some stock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I came on back downstairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you come downstairs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I used that push button elevator on the west side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear Mr. Truly yell anything up the elevator shaft?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I didn't hear anybody yell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or, did you see Mr. Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, when the FBI men&mdash;I imagine it was who it was&mdash;he
showed me his credentials, but he asked me who the manager was, and I told
him, "Mr. Truly." He told me to go find him. Well, I didn't know where
he was so I started from the first floor and just started looking for him, and
by the time I got to the sixth floor, they had found a gun and shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you went up to the sixth floor, it was after they found the
shotgun and shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, sir; and I found out later he was on the fourth floor,
which I didn't find.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see a gun around there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir; I sure didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see anybody with a gun in the place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any strangers in the building that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see Lee Oswald carry any sort of large package?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, I didn't, but some of the fellows said they did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who said that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, Bill Shelley, he told me that he thought he saw him
carrying a fairly good-sized package.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did Shelley tell you that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, it was&mdash;the day after it happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you sure you were on the fifth floor when you heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes, I'm positive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see any other employee on the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir; I didn't see nobody&mdash;there wasn't nobody on the
fifth floor at all&mdash;it was just myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told me that just before you heard the shots, you had been
on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then you went down to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody on the sixth floor when you were there, before
you went to the fifth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Oh, yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, there was Bill Shelley, Billy <span class="locked">Lovelady&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was in the morning, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That wasn't after lunch, was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After lunch, did you ever see them on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you hear this shot either before or after lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. It was before lunch&mdash;it was before lunch.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think it was before lunch you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. I believe it was&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were alone, were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all I have to ask you, and this will be written up and
if you would like to come down and read it and sign it, you can, or you can
waive your signature.</p>

<p>What do you want to do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, whatever you want to do&mdash;it doesn't make any difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you like to come down and read it over and sign it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. Well, if you've got time I'll sign it now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, we have to write it up&mdash;this has to be written up and it
will be so that you can read it. This young lady will notify you and you can
come down and read it over and sign it.</p>

<p>Will you do that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And we will mark these statements as Dougherty Exhibits Nos.
A, B, and C, and attach them to your deposition.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, and goodby.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Dougherty</span>. That's quite all right&mdash;thank you.</p>

<p>(Instruments referred to marked by the reporter as Dougherty Exhibits Nos.

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what did you do after that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I went to work then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I went to work doing harvest work, some in oil field in Chickasha,
Okla., and done farm work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you ever been in the Army?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How old are you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. 56.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you go to work for the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Well, I would say I have been working for them about 4 or 5
years&mdash;I'm not sure&mdash;I don't know exactly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work do you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Janitor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you been janitor ever since you were employed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever know a fellow named Lee Oswald, that worked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir; I know of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You knew of him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know him personally?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever speak to you, say "Hello" or anything of that sort?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; if he did, you hardly ever heard him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever speak to him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever reply to you that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. If he did, I didn't ever hear him. He mumbled something and
he would just keep walking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November 1963, you remember that day, don't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time did you go to work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was your usual time to go to work?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And, did you see Oswald that morning?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Down on the first floor filling orders.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him again that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. You mean all day&mdash;the rest of the day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that the last time you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Just at 12 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you at 12 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Down on the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was he doing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Well, I said to him&mdash;"It's about lunch time. I believe I'll go have
lunch." So, he says, "Yeah"&mdash;he mumbled something&mdash;I don't know whether he
said he was going up or going out, so I got my sandwich off of the radiator and
went on back to the first window of the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The first window on the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, not the first window&mdash;but on the first floor about the second
window on the first floor. I was intending to sit there so I could see the parade
because the street was so crowded with people&mdash;I didn't see anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said you sat at the second window&mdash;that would be what
window from the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Well, from the front door, you know where the front door is&mdash;going
back right down Elm, it's the second window from the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you sat down there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you sit on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. On a box.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you see out the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, I could see out the window but I couldn't see anything&mdash;too
many people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you eat your lunch there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you when the President's motorcade went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Now, I don't know&mdash;I was sitting there, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When the President went by, where were you sitting?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Probably sitting there in the same place.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you move from there from the time you had your lunch until
the President went by?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, I moved&mdash;when there was a shot, I moved.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When there was a shot you moved?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the time you had your lunch until the shot, did you move?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were at that window all of the time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. All the time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever go up on the sixth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you there at any time that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you above the first floor that day up to the time of the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Before the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. At 11 o'clock I went to the fourth floor to pick up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You went to the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, at 11 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you worked there for how long?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I would just take about 10 or 15 minutes to pick up&mdash;not quite
that long, to pick up the mail and stuff in the fourth floor office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I came back down to the third floor and picked up and from there
to the second and picked up and on to the first floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that what you usually did&mdash;was pick up?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir; every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you do that every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You pick up mail?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You pick up mail from what offices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. From&mdash;what the name of the office is?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The different offices?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Oh, I pick up mail first&mdash;on the fourth floor is Scott Pharmacy,
and I come down on the third floor and I pick up there in the hall, you know,
they have a hallway there and they put it out on the table&mdash;the packages and
the mail, and I pick it up there unless they've got a name on the boards to
see them in the office and then I go in the office. That's on the third floor. I
come down on the second floor and I pick up for Southwestern. I goes in the
office and that's the only office I go in there at Southwestern. Like I say&mdash;unless
there is anything on the board that says see Lon Cunningham, and then
I go in there. That's on the second floor, and from there back down to the
first floor, and I unloads on the table on the first floor and that's when I'm
through&mdash;I don't go back no more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You do that every day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At a certain time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At what time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. At 11 and 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, that day, November 22, 1963, you picked up the mail on
the fourth floor at 11 did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then came to the third?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then to the second?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what time did you come to the first floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Well, it was close to&mdash;around about&mdash;it must have been about
11:30&mdash;about 11:30 when I came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you leave the first floor from then on until lunch time, from
11:30 until 12?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time was it that you spoke to Oswald and said you thought
you would have your lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Just about 12 o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And do you remember exactly what he said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I don't remember exactly. All I remember him was
muttering out something&mdash;I didn't know whether he said he was going up or
going out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He said something like that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes&mdash;something like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see what he did?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see where he went?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told me that you went to the window?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is the second window to the right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of the front door&mdash;that would be looking toward Elm Street, is
that right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And were you sitting there when you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what you heard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I heard one shot, and then the next shot went off&mdash;the one that
shot him and I got on up and went on back, back where they make coffee at
the end of the counter where I could see what happened and before I could get
there, the third shot went off, and I seen the people all running and in a few
minutes someone came in the building, and I looked up and it was the bossman
and a policeman or someone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you heard one shot&mdash;you heard two shots and you got up
and then what happened, where did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I came out to the end of the counter where they make coffee
there by the stand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said you did it so you could see out better?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I did it to see what time it was&mdash;when all this happened&mdash;to
see what time it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time was it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. It was about between 12:30&mdash;between 12:27 and 12:30&mdash;something
like that, as near as I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you tell where the shots were coming from?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir&mdash;I couldn't, not for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The direction?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir; I couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look out the window later?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No more&mdash;no, sir; I didn't go back to any window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mentioned you saw Truly?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I don't know whether it was a policeman or FBI or who it was,
but another fellow was with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And where were you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Standing right there where they make coffee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. He ran in and yelled, "Where is the elevator?" And I said, "I
don't know, sir, Mr. Truly."</p>

<p>They taken off and went on up the stairway and that's all I know about
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you at any time go above the fourth floor on that date?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you at any time go that day up above the fourth floor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No&mdash;no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never did&mdash;either before or after the shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, that day, you went over to the sheriff's office and made a
statement, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir&mdash;no, sir; not that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you the next day?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Saturday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to the sheriff's department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. I went to the county&mdash;yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you tell them at any time that you saw Lee about 12
o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that Lee said, "I'm going up to eat?"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. He said either "up" or "out"&mdash;that's the way I reported it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's what you told them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on that day, did you tell them that the shots that you heard
seemed to come from inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did tell them that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that your best impression then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes; they seemed like they did come from the building, you know,
by the vibration of that window&mdash;it seemed like nobody had shot in the window
from the outside&mdash;it might have been coming from the building&mdash;is what I
figured.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told them that day that you thought it came from inside the
building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From inside the building?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, this statement you made to the sheriff's department, I'll
show it to you&mdash;that's a copy there and is that your signature?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Yes; that's my signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. We'll attach that as Exhibit A to your deposition.</p>

<p>(Instrument marked by the reporter as "Piper Exhibit No. A," for
identification.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This deposition will be written up and you can come down here
and look it over and sign it, if you wish.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or, you can waive your signature, just as you wish. Do you have
any choice&mdash;which had you rather do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Well, what is supposed to be done&mdash;I don't really quite understand?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You can do it either way. You see, we are going to write it up&mdash;this
young lady will write it up and if you want to come down and sign it, you
can come down and sign it, or you don't need to sign it. You can waive your
signature and we will send it on as it is written up. It is up to you which you
would rather do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Well, I can sign it, but I don't know when I am supposed to come
back to sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you will be notified.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. All right. I'll do that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, she will call you and ask you to come back and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. All right, I'll come back and sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Piper</span>. Thank you.</p>

Bryan and Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant
counsel of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you want to stand and raise your right hand, please. Do you
solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give before the President's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
Commission on the Assassination of President Kennedy shall be the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Would you please state your name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Victoria Elizabeth Adams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you known as Vickie Adams?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you live?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. 4906 Wenonah, Dallas, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I am employed as an office survey representative.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By whom?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Scott Foresman Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where do you work?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. On the fourth floor of the Texas School Book Depository.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. 411 Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is at the corner of Elm and Houston?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That is correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I might ask how old are you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Twenty-three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you born originally? In Texas?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. San Francisco, Calif.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you go to school in San Francisco?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I attended part of my grammar school and high school in San
Francisco.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you graduated from high school?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. In San Francisco, that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Following that I entered the Ursaline Order in St. Mary's,
Ohio, and I left there as a novice in 1961.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do from there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I went to Atlanta, Ga. and taught school at the Immaculate
Heart of Mary School. And following that I came to Dallas and was employed
by the Holiday Inn Central during the summer months, and I obtained a
teaching position at St. Monica's School here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And you taught at St. Monica for some period of time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes; for 1 year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went to work for Scott Foresman?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I went to work for Scott Foresman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you at work on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you aware of the fact that the President's motorcade was
going to go right by your building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you learn of this information?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Through newspaper media and also conversation.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember when you first read about it in the papers?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir; I don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it have been before November 22d?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when the motorcade passed?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I was at <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you inside or outside the building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I was inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Fourth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you watch the motorcade through a window?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometimes that is kind of complicated to try and pick out which
window if you are counting from the right or left, so I am going to count from
the east side of the building to the west side of the building.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
Now the windows are separate windows, but they are kind of in pairs, so
to speak. Were you standing on the first pair of windows, either one of those
two windows?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Counting from the east side, were you standing in the second
pair of windows?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the east side, were you standing in the third pair, of either
of those windows?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now of that third pair, from the east side, would it have been
the east window or the west window?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. The west window.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So another way, if you don't count in pairs, but count in single
units from the east side, you would have been in the sixth window from your
left as you were facing out the window, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you standing with anyone?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. With whom?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I was standing with Sandra Styles, Elsie Dorman, and Dorothy
May Garner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Will you state what you saw, what you did, and what you heard?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I watched the motorcade come down Main, as it turned from
Main onto Houston, and watched it proceed around the corner on Elm, and
apparently somebody in the crowd called to the late President, because he and
his wife both turned abruptly and faced the building, so we had a very good
view of both of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was their car as you got this good view, had it come directly
opposite your window? Had it come to that point on Elm, or not, if
you can remember?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I believe it was prior, just a second or so prior to that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. And from our vantage point we were able to see what the
President's wife was wearing, the roses in the car, and things that would attract
women's attention. Then we heard&mdash;then we were obstructed from the
view.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By what?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. A tree. And we heard a shot, and it was a pause, and then a
second shot, and then a third shot.</p>

<p>It sounded like a firecracker or a cannon at a football game, it seemed as if
it came from the right below rather than from the left above. Possibly because
of the report.</p>

<p>And after the third shot, following that, the third shot, I went to the back
of the building down the back stairs, and encountered Bill Shelley and Bill
Lovelady on the first floor on the way out to the Houston Street dock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say on the way out to the Houston Street dock, you
mean now you were on the way out?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. While I was on the way out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was anyone going along with you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir; Sandra Styles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sometime after the third shot, and I don't want to get into the
actual period of time yet, you went back into the stockroom which would be
to the north of where your offices are located on the fourth floor, is that
correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir; that's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got into the stockroom, where did you go?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I went to the back stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are there any other stairs that lead down from the fourth floor
other than those back stairs in the rear of the stockroom?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Those stairs would be in the northwest corner of the building,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You took those stairs. Were you walking or running as you
went down the stairs?</p>

<p>Miss. <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I was running. We were running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of shoes did you have on?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Three-inch heels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had heels. Now, as you were running down the stairs, did
you encounter anyone?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Not during the actual running down the stairs; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you left the Scott Foresman office and went into the stockroom,
did you see anyone until you got to the stairs on the fourth floor other
than the person you were with?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Outside of our office employees; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would these office employees that you might have seen, all be
women?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you got to the stairs and you started going down the stairs.
You went from the fourth floor to the third floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anyone on the stairs then?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. As you got to the stairs on the fourth floor,
did you notice whether or not the elevator was running?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. The elevator was not moving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How do you know it was not moving on some other floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Because the cables move when the elevator is moved, and this is
evidenced because of a wooden grate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that you mean a wooden door with slats in it that you have
to lift up to get on the elevator?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you look to see if the elevator was moving?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. It was not; no, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was not moving?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you happen to see where the elevator might have been located?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you got to the third door, did you take a look at the elevator
again at all, or not, if you remember?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I can't recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you got off the stairs on the third floor, did you see anyone
on the third floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you immediately went to the stairs going down from the
third to the second?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As you ran down the stairs, did you see anyone on the stairs?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. You got down to the second floor. Did you see anyone
by the second floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you immediately turn and run and keep on running down the
stairs towards the first floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got to the bottom of the first floor, did you see anyone
there as you entered the first floor from the stairway?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who did you see?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Mr. Bill Shelley and Billy Lovelady.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you see them on the first floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Well, this is the stairs, and this is the Houston Street dock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
that I went out. They were approximately in this position here, so I don't know
how you would describe that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are looking now at a first floor plan or diagram of the Texas
School Book Depository, and you have pointed to a position where you encountered
Bill Lovelady and Mr. Bill Shelley?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It would be slightly east of the front of the east elevator, and
probably as far south as the length of the elevator, is that correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I have a document here called Commission's Exhibit No. 496,
which includes a diagram of the first door, and there is a No. 7 and a circle
on it, and I have pointed to a place marked No. 7 on the diagram. Is that
correct?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That is approximate.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Between the time you got off the stairs and the time you got to
this point when you say you encountered them, which was somewhat to the south
and a little bit east of the front of the east elevator, did you see any other
employees there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Any other people prior to the time you saw them?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you were running down the stairs on your trip down
the stairs, did you hear anyone using the stairs?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear anyone calling for an elevator?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the foreman, Roy Truly? Did you see the superintendent
of the warehouse, Roy S. Truly?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir; I did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about any motorcycle police officers?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now what did you do after you encountered Mr. Shelley and
Mr. Lovelady?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I said I believed the President was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what they said?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I proceeded out to the Houston Street dock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be on this same diagram? It is marked Houston
Street dock, and you went through what would be the north door, which is
towards the rear of the first floor, is that correct?</p>

<p>And down some stairs towards the rear of the dock?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you go from there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I proceeded&mdash;which way is east and west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. East is here. East is towards Houston, and west is towards the
railroad tracks.</p>

<p>You went east or west? Towards the railroad tracks or towards Houston
Street?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I went west towards the tracks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far west did you go?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I went approximately 2 yards within the tracks and there was
an officer standing there, and he said, "Get back to the building." And I said,
"But I work here."</p>

<p>And he said, "That is tough, get back."</p>

<p>I said, "Well, was the President shot?"</p>

<p>And he said, "I don't know. Go back."</p>

<p>And I said, "All right."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I went back, only I went southwest.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, did you come back by way of the street, or did you come
back the same entrance you went out?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went back in through the front entrance, through the front
of the building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Well, I didn't go back in right away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>There is a street that would be a continuation of Elm Street that goes in
front of the building, and Elm Street itself angles into the freeway. Did you
go back either of those streets?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir. I went by the one directly in front of the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. When I got there, I happened to look around and noticed several
of the employees, and I noticed Joe Molina, for one, was standing in front of
the building, and also Avery Davis, who works with me, and I said, "What do
you think has happened?"</p>

<p>And she said, "I don't know."</p>

<p>And I said, "I want to find out." I think the President is shot.</p>

<p>There was a motorcycle that was parked on the corner of Houston and Elm
directly in front of the east end of the building, and I paused there to listen to
the report on the police radio, and they said that shots had been fired which
apparently came either from the second floor or the fourth floor window, and
so I panicked, as I was at the only open window on the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they say second floor or second floor from the top?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. It said second floor. So then I decided maybe I had better go
back into the building, and going up the <span class="locked">stairs&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now at this time when you went back into the building, were
there any policemen standing in front of the building keeping people out?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. There was an officer on the stairs itself, and he was prohibiting
people from entering the building, that is correct. But I told him I worked
there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he let you come back in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Following that, I pushed the button for the passenger elevator,
but the power had been cut off on the elevator, so I took the stairs to the
second floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then went all the way back to the northwest corner of the
building and took the same set of stairs you had previously taken to come down,
or did you take the stairs by the passenger elevator?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. By the passenger elevator.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do those stairs go above floor 2?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir; they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the second floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I went into the Texas School Book Depository office and just
listened for a few minutes to the people that were congregating there, and decided
there wasn't anything interesting going on, and went out and walked
around the hall to the freight elevator meaning the one on the northwest
corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would it have been the west or the east? The one nearest the
stairs or the other one?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes; the one nearest the stairs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I went into the elevator which was stopped on the second floor,
with two men who were dressed in suit and hats, and I assumed they were
plainclothesmen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I tried to get the elevator to go to the fourth floor, but it wasn't
operating, so the gentlemen lifted the elevator gate and we went out and ran up
the stairs to the fourth floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went back to the Scott Foresman Company offices?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now trying to reconstruct your actions insofar as the time sequence,
which we haven't done, what is your best estimate of the time between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
the time the shots were fired and the time you got back to the building? How
much time elapsed? If you have any estimate. Maybe you don't have one.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I would estimate not more than 5 minutes elapsed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any particular reason why you make this estimation?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir; going down the stairs toward the back, I was running.
I ran to the railroad tracks. I moved quickly to the front of the building,
paused briefly to talk to someone, listened only to the report of the windows from
which the shot supposedly was fired, and returned to the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long do you think it was between the time the shots were
fired and the time you left the window to start toward the stairway?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Between 15 and 30 seconds, estimated, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long do you think it was, or do you think it took you to get
from the window to the top of the fourth floor stairs?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I don't think I can answer that question accurately, because the
time approximation, without a stopwatch, would be difficult.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How long do you think it took you to get from the window to the
bottom of the stairs on the first floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I would say no longer than a minute at the most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you think that from the time you left the window on the fourth
floor until the time you got to the stairs at the bottom of the first floor, was
approximately 1 minute?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, approximately.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As I understand your testimony previously, you saw neither Roy
Truly nor any motorcycle police officer at any time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You heard no one else running down the stairs?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got to the first floor did you immediately proceed to
this point where you say you encountered Mr. Shelley and Mr. Lovelady?</p>

<p>Well, you showed me on a diagram of the first floor that there was a place
which was south and somewhat east of the front part of the east elevator that
you encountered Truly and Lovelady?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I saw them there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I mean; you saw them?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would that have been a matter of seconds after you got to the
bottom of the first floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Definitely.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Less than 30 seconds?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know, or did you know Lee Harvey Oswald either by
sight or by name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I didn't know Lee Harvey Oswald, per se. I didn't know his
name. I recognized him after I saw him on television, as having been with
some men, but I had no dealing with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By that, you mean having been employed with some men by the
Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. During the trip down the stairs on the way down did you ever
encounter Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there any other information that you can think of that might
be relevant to anything connected with the assassination?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. At the time I left the building on the Houston Street dock,
there was an officer standing about 2 yards from the curb, and about from the
curb across the street from the Texas School Depository, and about 4 yards from
the corner of Houston and Elm, and when we were running out the dock, going
around the building, the officer was standing there, and he didn't encounter us
or ask us what we were doing or where we were going, and I don't know if that
is pertinent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No one stopped you from getting out of the building when you
left?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is helpful information. Is there any other information
that you have that could be relevant?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. There was a man that was standing on the corner of Houston
and Elm asking questions there. He was dressed in a suit and a hat, and
when I encountered Avery Davis going down, we asked who he was, because
he was questioning people as if he were a police officer, and we noticed him take
a colored boy away on a motorcycle, and this man was asking questions very
efficaciously, and we said, "I guess he is maybe a reporter," and later on on
television, there was a man that looked very similar to him, and he was identified
as Ruby.</p>

<p>And on questioning some police officer, they said they had witnesses to the
fact that he was in the Dallas Morning News at the time. And I don't know
whether that is relevant or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is all right, we want to get that information down. Was
this before you got back in the front door of the building that you saw this?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir; while I was standing by the motorcycles.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That is all, I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Miss Adams, you have the opportunity if you would like, to read
this deposition and sign it before it goes to Washington, or you can waive
the signing of it and just let the court reporter send it directly to us. Do you
have any preference?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. I think I will let you use your own discretion.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It doesn't make any difference to us. If it doesn't make any
difference, we can waive it and you won't have to make another trip down
here.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. That is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We want to thank you for your cooperation. We know that it
has taken time on your part. Would you also thank your employer?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Adams</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<hr />
<h2 id="t393"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_GENEVA_L_HINE" id="TESTIMONY_OF_GENEVA_L_HINE">TESTIMONY OF GENEVA L. HINE</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Geneva L. Hine was taken at 2:45 p.m., on April 7, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel of
the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Please stand up and hold up your right hand. Do you solemnly
swear the testimony you will give the Commission will be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Geneva L. Hine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where do you live.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. 2305 Oakdale Road in Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me something about yourself; where you were born
and raised, and educated and what kind of work you have done.</p>

<p>Miss. <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. I was born and raised in Martinsville, Ind., and I graduated from
elementary and junior high and high school at that same town. I attended the
Ball State Teachers' College in Muncie, Ind., and I attended Metropolitan Bible
Institute in Suffern, N.Y., and I received my Bachelor of Science theology degree
from Assembly of God College in Waxahachie, Tex.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do after that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Oh, I have always worked as a one-girl office girl until the job
I have now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you go to work at the Texas School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. In December 1956.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work do you do there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. I have the credit desk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, in November, November 22, 1963, where was your desk; in
what part of the building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. My desk was on the second floor, the inside wall just along by
the corridor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you spend most of your time at your desk?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. At that time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; at that time.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir; the girls were gone and they wanted to go out and see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I mean did you spend most of your time in your work&mdash;it was a
desk job?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes; that's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go in the other floors of the building any?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; as my duties necessitated I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever know a fellow named Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you first meet him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. I never met him to know his name but I saw him every day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did you see him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Downstairs in the warehouse or stockroom whichever you want
to call it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The first floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him on any other floors?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; I saw him on the second floor about noontime almost
every day. He would come in and ask for change, for a dime or quarter.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him use any part of the second floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him spend the dime to buy anything with it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir; the coke machine isn't in our room and I wouldn't have
seen it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is the coke machine?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Out in the little lunchroom back of our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever speak to Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever speak to you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He never replied to you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you say he was unfriendly?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; I would.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him smile or laugh?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of an expression did he have on his face most of the
time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. I describe it as being stoic.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's a pretty good description if he doesn't smile.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. It was <span class="locked">just&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever mention this to any of the people around there about
Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; I mentioned it to Mr. Shelley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you tell him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. One day I said to Mr. Shelley, "Who is that queer duck you have
working down here" and I said that just as a matter of slang because I've
known Mr. Shelley for a long time and I was just talking to him, you see, and
usually, all the boys that work down there speak to me because I have to go down
there to pick up the little "comp" or gift slips on my desk. Every time I went
by him I would speak to him, say "Good morning" and he would never catch or
meet my gaze so I just made that remark to Mr. Shelley because I had spoken
to him so many times and he never answered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did Shelley say?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. He said that was just his way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November 1963, did you know that there was to be
a motorcade or parade come by your building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Oh, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you find that out?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Sir, I don't remember. I probably heard over the news but I
cannot remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were just aware of the fact?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes; I knew it and the girls were discussing it in the office that
morning. Many of them, probably six, had not seen the President close. You
see, I had seen him on two different occasions and I had been very close to him
and so they were lamenting that they couldn't go out so I spoke up and said
"I will be glad to answer the telephone so you girls may go out and see the
motorcade" and I had previously answered the telephone when we were in the
other building before we moved in this building, so they were delighted and I
thought nothing about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they all go out?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; everyone went out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anyone left in the office part of the building on that
second floor office?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Only Mr. Williams and myself and he stayed with me because he
was working on his desk until he thought that the motorcade was about there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then he went out?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. When he thought it was about there he said "I think I will go
out for 5 minutes."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is his name?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Otis N. Williams.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He works in the office, too?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have to change your desk over to another desk?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; to the middle desk on the front row.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there a switchboard?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir; we have a telephone with three incoming lines, then we
have the warehouse line and we have an intercom system.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't have a switchboard?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Not now; we did in the other building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you alone then at this time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you stay at your desk?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; I was alone until the lights all went out and the phones
became dead because the motorcade was coming near us and no one was calling
so I got up and thought I could see it from the east window in our office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to the window?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you look out?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. I saw the escort car come first up the middle of Houston Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Going north on Houston Street?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; going north on Houston Street. I saw it turn left and
I saw the President's car coming and I saw the President and saw him waving
his hand in greeting up in the air and I saw his wife and I saw him turn the
corner and after he turned the corner I looked and I saw the next car coming
just at the instant I saw the next car coming up was when I heard the shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many did you hear?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you tell where the shots were coming from?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; they came from inside the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Because the building vibrated from the result of the explosion
coming in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It appeared to you that the shots came from the building?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you know they were shots at the time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; they sounded almost like cannon shots they were so
terrific.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is when you were at the window, is that right?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; that is when I was at the window, because the next
car, you see, was coming up and turning and I looked. Of course I looked
when I heard the shots. I just stood there and saw people running to the east
up Elm Street. I saw people running; I saw people falling down, you know,
lying down on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was on Houston Street?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir; Elm.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could see&mdash;could you see any part of Elm?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. East, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You could see east on Elm?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; I could see east on Elm. I saw them run across east
on Elm away from where his car had gone and my first thought was if I could
only see what happened, so I went out our front door into the foyer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the front door to the office?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That opens <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. The foyer, little hall, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Steps lead down?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; but there is a door before the steps and the elevator
is to my left and I went past the hall that goes to my right and I knocked on the
door of Lyons and Carnahan; that's a publishing company.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do then?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. I tried the door, sir, and it was locked and I couldn't get in and
I called, "Lee, please let me in," because she's the girl that had that office, Mrs.
Lee Watley, and she didn't answer. I don't know if she was there or not,
then I left her door. I retraced my steps back to where the hall turns to my
left and went down it to Southwestern Publishing Co.'s door and I tried their
door and the reason for this was because those windows face out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On to Elm?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes; and on to the triple underpass.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. And there was a girl in there talking on the telephone and I
could hear her but she didn't answer the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the door locked?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was which company?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Southwestern Publishing Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you call to her?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. I called and called and shook the door and she didn't answer
me because she was talking on the telephone; I could hear her. They have a
little curtain up and I could see her form through the curtains. I could see her
talking and I knew that's what she was doing and then I turned and went
through the back hall and came through the back door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Of your office, the second floor office?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes; and I went straight up to the desk because the telephones
were beginning to wink; outside calls were beginning to come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they did come in rapidly?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. They did come in rapidly.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When you came back in did you see Mrs. Reid?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir; I don't believe there was a soul in the office when I
came back in right then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see anybody else go in through there?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir; after I answered the telephone then there was about
four or five people that came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anybody in that room when you came back in and
went to the telephone?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir; not to my knowledge.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Mrs. Reid come back in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; I think I felt sure that I did. I thought that there
were five or six that came in together. I thought she was one of those.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Reid told us she came in alone and when she came in she
didn't see anybody there.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Well, it could be that she did, sir. I was talking on the phones
and then came the policemen and then came the press. Everybody was wanting
an outside line and then our vice president came in and he said "The next
one that was clear, I have to have it" and so I was busy with the phone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. From the time you walked into the room you became immediately
busy with the phone?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir; sure was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see Oswald come in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. My back would have been to the door he was supposed to have
come in at.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you facing the door he is supposed to have left by?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you recall seeing him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you have any definite recollection of Mrs. Reid coming in?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. No, sir; I only saw four or five people that came by and they all
came and were all talking about how terrible it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember their names?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who were they?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Mr. Williams, Mr. Molina (spelling), Miss Martha Reid, Mrs.
Reid, Mrs. Sarah Stanton, and Mr. Campbell; that's all I recall, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Miss Hine, this will be written up and it will be submitted for
your signature if you wish, or you can waive signature right now; which do
you prefer? Do you have any choice?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Well, I would prefer to see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Prefer to see it, all right, then this young lady will inform you
to come down, read it, look it over and sign it.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thanks very much for coming in.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hine</span>. You are very welcome.</p>

<p>The testimony of Miss Doris Burns was taken at 3:20 p.m., on April 7, 1964, in
the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay Streets,
Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern, assistant counsel
of the President's Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Please stand up and hold up your right hand and be sworn.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. (complying).</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you solemnly swear the testimony you give will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I do.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your name, please?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Doris Burns.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your address?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. 2617 Shelby, Dallas.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your occupation?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I am a correspondent for the Macmillan Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is your office?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. In the Texas School Book Depository Building on the third
floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me something about yourself, where you were born
and what your education is, and what your business occupation has been.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Well, I was born in Tyler, Tex., and I graduated from high
school here in Dallas and I worked many years for lawyers here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Well, I was just a legal secretary and worked for Vanette
Hosiery Mills, secretary to the president. They are not here any more, I don't
think. After that I worked for a geologist.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Most of your work has been secretarial, has it?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Yes, but at Macmillan I mostly compose my own letters.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you go to work for Macmillan?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. April 19, 1955. Am I too fast?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She can write as fast as you talk.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. That's wonderful.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Go right ahead.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Let's see, I've forgotten what else you wanted to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, first of all, you went to work in 1955?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is the office of the Macmillan Co.?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Well, at that time it was on Ross and Akard; <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was it in November 1963?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. At Elm and Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What part of the building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. On the third floor, room 301.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are there any windows in those offices?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Yes; they have some windows; they face the west, I guess you
would say. They don't overlook the route of the <span class="locked">President's&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do they or do they not overlook Elm Street?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. They do not overlook Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They overlook the railroad yards, do they?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On November 22d, what were you doing that day?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I was listening to the radio as I worked.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About noon, did you go to lunch?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Well, I had lunch at the office and then I didn't intend to go see
the President, didn't have any desire to but I left about&mdash;I don't remember the
exact time but, anyway, when I left they said on the radio that he&mdash;that the
motorcade was coming up, I believe it was Cedar Springs; anyway, he hadn't
been away from the airport long and that he was going about 5 miles an hour
so everybody could see him. Well, thinking he was going that slowly, I thought
I had plenty of time, so I walked up to Sanger's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To where?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Sanger's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where is that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. It's about four blocks up Elm Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which way on Elm&mdash;east?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. East; you see, we are down at the extreme west end of the
street; nothing else down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I bought some Kleenex and came back, and everybody was out
on the steps to look, but I didn't stop. I went on back to the office.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the third floor?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was anybody in the office?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Yes; Mrs. Case hadn't ever gone out. She was there. I believe
she was the only one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I listened to the radio, and by that time they said that he was
on Main and turning at Houston or Main by the courthouse, so since he was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
close, I thought, well, I guess I will go look out the window. I didn't care
enough to go downstairs, but I thought I will go look out the window. So I
thought I would have plenty of time, if he was just coming around Main Street,
that I could still get around there, so I went around to American Book Co., which
is the office closest to us that had a window looking out on Elm. There was
nobody in there, so then I started down the hall to Allyn and Bacon. As I
went down this hall towards the windows that looked out on Houston Street, I
heard a shot, but I didn't think much about it. I didn't, of course, know it was
a shot because when you hear tires backfire and all, they all sound alike to me,
so I didn't think a thing about that.</p>

<p>I went around to Allyn and Bacon, and Mr. Wilson, the manager, was at the
window looking out. He was the only one in there, so I asked him if I could
look out the window with him. About that time he said "Oh, my God, there's
been a shooting." I still didn't think anybody, of course, had been killed, just
thought somebody had shot in the air or something, so I said "Has the President
already passed? And he said "Yes," so I looked out and that big bus that had
the press in it, had the word "Press" or whatever it was on the bus, was passing,
so I said "Well, I guess I have missed the President then," and I started on
back out of the office and I just said as I left, "Well, I hope nobody got hurt."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You heard how many shots?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. One.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just one?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. It must have been the last one because I didn't hear any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have any idea where it was coming from?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Well, it just sounded as though it was back of me. You see, I
was going towards Houston Street. I was facing east and it sounded to me as
if it came toward my back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were in the building?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Yes; I was in the building.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Walking down the hall?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Walking down the hall going towards Allyn and Bacon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what happened after that?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I came on back and listened to the radio some more and in a few
minutes, why, they told it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever know Lee Harvey Oswald?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I rode on the elevator with him one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. But I didn't know who he was&mdash;about a week before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never talked to him?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I never talked to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who were you with at the time this happened?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. The Macmillan Co.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who was in the office with you?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Mrs. Case, but I couldn't see her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. She was in the same office?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I have a private office. She was around the corner where her
office is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Case?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you hear anybody running down the stairs at any time?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. Yes, but I didn't <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. It was after that; I went to the restroom.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long after?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I imagine maybe it was 25 minutes. I imagine it was the
policeman or somebody; of course, I don't know who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I think that's all, Miss Burns. This will be written up and you
can sign it; you can read it and sign it or you can waive your signature if you
wish and you won't have to come back here. Which would you rather do?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Burns</span>. I can waive signature if that is all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fine, thank you very much, Miss Burns.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you are willing to testify, are you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And give us as much help as you can?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is your&mdash;you have given us your address, haven't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me something, briefly, about your past life? Where
you were born and what your education was and what your occupation has
been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I was born in the country. Town of about 12 miles from Corsicanna,
Tex. My father was a doctor down there, and I was a second child;
I have a brother older than I am. And then I moved to Ennis, and then come
to Dallas and lived here until I was a little girl, 4 or 5 years old, then I went
back down to Ennis and my father practiced medicine in Ennis, Tex., and then
about&mdash;I married then when I was 17, and then I moved around quite a little
while I was married, but&mdash;and then my husband and I, we had trouble, and
I divorced him in&mdash;oh, about in 1925, and I raised my two children by myself,
and I have been in the place where I live 24 years, and over on the back, I was&mdash;I
have been here 43 years in the neighborhood, and I raised both of my boys,
and they are grown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your occupation has been that of a housewife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes. Well, I had rented rooms, but I had some money my
father had given me. I had some money from him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your present address, you rent rooms, do you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I do, now. I have just started in September again. My
son left home, you see, and I <span class="locked">started&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was September of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How large a house is that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, it is all on one floor. And I have four bedrooms, but
I rent three.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In September of 1963, you were living there alone, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; my son was living there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you rent rooms before your son left your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, let's see, now, oh, yes; uh-huh, in September <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Except his bedroom?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he left you rented another bedroom, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well yes; I am trying to. Haven't got it rented.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you ever rent a room in your home to Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me about the first time that you ever saw him. What
the date was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. The first time I ever saw him or heard of him, I was in the
backyard doing a lot of yardwork. I come around the house and he was standing
on the porch, and he said, "Do you have a room for rent?"</p>

<p>I had a "for rent" sign out. I said, "Yes" and he said, "May I see it?"</p>

<p>And I wanted&mdash;"Yes"; and then I was trying to size him up to get in that room,
and&mdash;in the house, and I said, "Are you married?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Yes; I am married. I just want this for a short time. My wife
lives at Irving."</p>

<p>And then we got inside the house and he had a thing where this&mdash;pictures of
his wife and baby, and he said he was in the Marine Corps, and I tried to be nice
to him, and so, he paid me $7, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then did he tell you what his name was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. His name was Oswald, and he put it on this thing, and my son
took it and sold it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said he put it on this thing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. This right here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is, "this thing"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Mary, why don't you pull up your chair and be comfortable
while you are doing this. Now, you are all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you have a calendar here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That is my calendar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is the calendar for December 1963, and I notice it has dates
and names and dates. Is that the way you keep books on your rooms?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; but I don't now. I did then, because I just had started.
The first one I got was in September.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. September of 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He put his name on the calendar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, got it in September. He got it, my son sold it for $5, and
I didn't even know that he tore that out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, let me see here in this calendar. It runs from January 1963,
to December of 1963, but October of 1963, has been torn out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh. And he said his name was Lee Oswald was what his
name was, and I said, "Well, I can't think of that name Oswald, I will call
you Lee."</p>

<p>So, he put it down on the 4th. Just rented for a week, you see, the 7th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You said the 4th?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. On the 7th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 7th of October? That is the first day you ever saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Ever saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 7th of October you rented the room to him, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And is that the date that he put his name on the calendar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; that is the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He paid you $7?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. $7 in money.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the rental?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. For one room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. For one room for 1 week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did he move into the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Right then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have his things?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Had his things on his hand and had his bag, but after he paid
my $7 he went out&mdash;I don't know, I think this YMCA, but I am not supposed
to know where, and brought back another bag, and then he said,
"Well, where is the grocery store?"</p>

<p>Well, I said, "It is down that way," but I didn't want him to use the
kitchen, so, he said, "I'm going to get some milk," and so, I didn't like that
much, but I didn't say anything about it because I wanted to get along with
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me ask you some questions before we commence the grocery
store part of it.</p>

<p>When you first saw him, did he have his luggage with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he have with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. A bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you describe the bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't remember where&mdash;seemed like it was a kind of a
duffelbag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The kind the men in the service put their clothes in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; and had some on his arm, these coathangers, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had some things on a coathanger?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And had a clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. A clock, wrapped up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color was this duffelbag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I think it was blue.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the only bag he had with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, he went off to town and got another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then he went off to town and brought another bag back, would
you describe that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, I didn't pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it leather <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Could you give me any idea of the size of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, it was big. About like that [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About like that, you mean, oh, 3 feet long, 2 feet, 2½?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; about like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">About&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. As well as I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About 2 feet long? Was it brown?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I just couldn't remember. I didn't pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember the color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember him carrying it into the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I remember he went in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. But, I didn't pay any attention. He rented the room, and
I didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he carry it by a handle, or in his arms?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I guess he carried it by a handle, but I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He brought two bags into this room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; wasn't but one when he come in, but next time he went
<span class="locked">off&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He brought another one back?</p>

<p>How did he come out there, do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know. I don't know whether he come here&mdash;he come
and just knocked on the door. I was in the backyard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After he moved, after he put his bags in his room, did he leave?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he <span class="locked">said&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I mean, did he leave to go downtown to get the other bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh, and come back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him leave?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The time he went to get the other bag, did you see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know what kind of transportation he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I guess I didn't pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see him drive up in a car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, always took a bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I saw&mdash;one time he stopped over there across the street
and get the bus that is the only time I didn't&mdash;I didn't watch what he did. Of
course, I had no idea he was the kind of man he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say that he asked you where the grocery store was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that when he came back with this second bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; uh-huh, I got him something to eat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to him anything about his using your refrigerator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. One question. Ask her how long he was gone and you will
know how far he went. That is what I wanted to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he left to get this second bag, how long was he gone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, not over an hour. About an hour. It wasn't a long&mdash;I
wondered then where he went, but it wasn't none of my business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say now not over an hour. Do you think it might have been
less than an hour?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I believe less than an hour.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How much less?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I'd say 40 minutes, anyway, at most.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This was in the afternoon, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; started at 3 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 3 o'clock he came to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then he came back the second time with the second bag
before 4, did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I'm sure he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you talk to him any about the use of the refrigerator?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, he said he was going to put something in there, and I
said&mdash;I didn't have anything to say, and I hemmed-and-hawed, I said, "Well, no;
I don't have a very big refrigerator."</p>

<p>Well, he said, "I won't use it after this time." He was very, very congenial.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he go down to the grocery store?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he buy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He bought some peanut butter and some sardines, and some
bananas and put it all in his room, except the milk, and he ate there, ate
in his room. I didn't like that either.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was there how many days?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He was there 5 days, just 5 days.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was there&mdash;what day of the week was the day that he came?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Monday and Tuesday he stayed home and went to bed, and
stayed&mdash;I didn't pay any attention to <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Monday night he stayed home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; after he went to the grocery store.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Tuesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Tuesday he went out at 9:30 and come home at 2:30. He
was looking for a job, and called on the phone, wanted different ones, and I
got the book, and papers, and tried to look for him a job, because he was a nice
looking boy, and wanted a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, he went out at 9&ndash;9:30 in the morning and came back at 2:30?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Let's see. 1:30. I have my nap then, and it kind of interfered,
but I didn't say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say you have a what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I have a nap then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You take a nap in the afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I had a stroke, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And it interfered with your nap when he came back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; but I didn't say anything then, but then the next <span class="locked">day&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let's finish Tuesday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. All right. That's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he go out again after he came home at 1:30?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Stayed in his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. All the time, and stayed there that night, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All the time? What about Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He left about 9 o'clock, and went off dressed. Had a white
shirt and white tie and white&mdash;white trousers, and looked very nice. Went
off Monday about 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Wednesday. Then he got back at 1:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me see, he left at 9?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Come back at 1:30?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did he go out again that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; but then he talked to somebody on the phone, and talked
in a foreign language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean when? Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. On Wednesday, I guess it was Wednesday, but I am sure it
must have been Wednesday. I was in my room, and the telephone is over
there [indicating], and I didn't like that, somebody talking in a foreign language
and, so I told my girl friend, I said, "I don't like anybody talking in a foreign
language."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time of day did he call on the phone and talk in a foreign
language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He come home at 1:30 and talked about 2 or 2:30, talked like
that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he go out again that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; went to bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Went to bed that night and stayed there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And I didn't fix his room either, that is why I didn't see his
luggage. I didn't go in his room at all because they take care of their own rooms.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Thursday, he went out at 10 o'clock or 10:30, and I was out in
the yard, and he come out and I said, "Oh. I thought you had gone."</p>

<p>"Oh, no," he said, he didn't go, but he came home a little bit early, and after
I said he got into my nap, he come home at 2 o'clock, or 2:30, you see, and
didn't leave until 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you tell him that he interfered with your nap?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What day did you tell him that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I told him that, I guess must have been Thursday. Thursday
and then <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean Thursday morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, then Thursday morning is when he left a little later than
usual?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you told him that he had interfered with your nap before that
day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I think it was&mdash;it must have been&mdash;no; it was that day.
It was after I had that call. I didn't like that and he never said a word, and
then I interviewed him when he first came in and thought he was all right,
and he never spoke&mdash;I had one boy on the back. He never saw him and he
would run to the bathroom and go to the icebox and get some ice, and didn't
like that. Went too much to the icebox, <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, <span class="locked">now&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That was a Thursday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he went away on Thursday, then had you told him prior to
that time that when he came in at 1:30, in the afternoon, he interfered with
your nap?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you think you might have told him that on Wednesday or
Tuesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't tell him until after I had that call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was the call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. On Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who called you on Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He called somebody, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the day that he called someone and spoke in a foreign
language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After that, you told <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That he interfered with your nap?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh. I didn't like it, and the next day he fussed with
somebody on the phone, I don't know whether it was his wife or who it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was Thursday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About what time of day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. About 2 o'clock or 2:30 when he come home here <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he go out again that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Stayed in all day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Stayed in all day, and it was Friday he stayed in his room all
day. Didn't eat. Ate what he had in his room. Stayed in his room all day
long.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you next see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Been&mdash;then Saturday, he started out and had his bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Started out with his luggage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Saturday morning he started out with his bag <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which bag did he take?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it the duffelbag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Like you see the servicemen carrying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I guess it was. I didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This was Saturday morning about what time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. About 10 o'clock, or 9:30 and I thought he was going to move
and I&mdash;"Oh&mdash;" I said, "You are going to move?"</p>

<p>And he said, "No; I am just going for the weekend."</p>

<p>Well, I said, "Well, I don't know."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
But he said, "And I want my room cleaned and clean sheets put on the bed."</p>

<p>And I said, "Well, I will after you move because you are going to move."</p>

<p>He said, "Why?"</p>

<p>I says, "Because I am not going to rent to you any more."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Not going to what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Not going to rent to you any more, He said, "Give me back
my money." Now, $2.</p>

<p>I said, "Well, I don't have it."</p>

<p>So, he left Saturday morning and, in the meantime. I think his wife was
going to have a <span class="locked">baby&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I found&mdash;I read it in the papers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he ever tell you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, no; he didn't ever tell me. Didn't tell me anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You told him you weren't going to rent to him any more on that
Saturday morning about 10 o'clock. At that time did he have his bag? Was
he carrying a bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; going out with it again. Going out to Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How did you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, said he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He told you he was going to Irving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; said he was going to Irving.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you he was going to Irving for any purpose?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; just said he was going to Irving. No; he didn't tell me
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you tell him you wouldn't rent to him any more?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Because I didn't like him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't like his attitude. He was just kind of like this, you
know, just big shot, you know, and I didn't have anything to say to him, and&mdash;but,
I didn't like him. There was just something about him I didn't like or
want him&mdash;just wasn't the kind of person I wanted. Just didn't want him
around me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he left on Saturday morning do you know by what transportation
he took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is there a bus stop near your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Right in front of the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him take the bus.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him wait for the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I just saw him go out the door. Didn't pay any attention.
And when he left I said&mdash;oh, he was going to come back and get his things
Saturday. He took it out and said, "Well, it is 2 dollars," and I&mdash;"Well, I
don't have it, so, he went off."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, wait a minute. Did he say he would come back and get
the things Saturday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he didn't say a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, wait a minute. Saturday morning you told him you wouldn't
rent to him again. What did he say about getting his money back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, he said, "Well, give me my money back and I will move
now."</p>

<p>And I said, "I don't have it."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Didn't say anything and went on out the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there anything said about whether he would come to get
his clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; not a thing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he come back Saturday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did he come back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Monday morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And from Saturday morning until Monday morning you didn't
see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time Monday morning did he come back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Between 8 and 9, 9 and 10. I mean.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he came back did he have anything with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have his bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; didn't say a word to him. He&mdash;I didn't say a word to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he came back did he have anything in his hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you see him leave?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he take with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He had that bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. The bag, you see, he had two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. But, I never noticed it. I don't know what kind it was or
anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he left, he had one bag when he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. One bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know whether it was the duffelbag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I couldn't say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what color it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; just navy blue. I don't know which one he carried, or
what they were or what. I didn't pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know whether both bags were navy blue, or different
colors?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know one was navy blue?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he left, did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or did you say anything to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No. I said, "Good luck." You know, I thought to myself,
"That's good riddance," and I looked in his room and it was all right, and
nothing was disturbed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had he cleaned it up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; it was dirty.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he leave anything around the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; somehow I saw a map. I believe he left that map.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What map?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. A map of Dallas where he could get around to get some
places, jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do with that map?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Throwed it in the garbage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Threw it away?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it a map, kind of a map put out by the service stations?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; one of those kinds. I just threw it away and cleaned up
the room. Just threw it away.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did the map have any markings on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You know&mdash;do you know what the markings were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; didn't pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did you ever see him again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I thought. "Well, he is gone," and forgot it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But, before you go into that, I notice you have been reading
from some notes before you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, because I forget what I have to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you make those notes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. What day did I make them?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. When Mr. Sorrels and I were talking about her going to Washington,
he made the suggestion that she put all the things down on paper because
she might forget something, and I said, "Mary, you put everything on
a piece of paper so that you can remember it and you won't forget anything,
you know, what happened," and that's when she started making notes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You have made the notes in the last week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. At my suggestion and Mr. Sorrels.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't make any notes during the week he was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Your address, make sure that we have this. The address where
you were living on the 7th of October was 621 Marsalis&mdash;North Marsalis, Dallas,
Tex.?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That's right. Marsalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you are still living there, aren't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the foreign language that you heard Oswald using over
the telephone on this Wednesday afternoon, do you know what the language was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are you familiar with the Spanish language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I am not. Not familiar with any of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All you know it was not English?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But, you can't tell what language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you make a guess?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I have no idea. I do, because the girl is Spanish, but
I don't know whether he called her or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What girl is Spanish?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I mean&mdash;his wife was Russian.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Russian.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when did you see Oswald again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I went down to the parade. Oh, when was the parade?
The 22d of&mdash;the next&mdash;22d of February&mdash;when was the parade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The 22d of November the President came to Dallas.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And I first got off at Neiman's and I&mdash;the parade didn't come
on, and I kept walking on up, and walked in front of Titche's over on that
side there, and I saw the parade there. He passed&mdash;I saw the President, oh,
I was happy I got to see him. And&mdash;so then I got on across and went over
to the Athletic Club, and caught the bus.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What bus did you catch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I don't remember whether it was the Marsalis or the
Romana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Both go by your house, do they? What was the last one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. The Marsalis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What was the second name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Romana.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And both go west on Elm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Right&mdash;so, I got on the bus, and while it was awfully crowded
<span class="locked">there&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean crowded on the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there many people on the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How many people on the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, about 10.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what was the location on Elm where you boarded this bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. At the Athletic Club.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What cross street is that, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. St. Paul.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. St. Paul? You got on at St. Paul? St. Paul and Elm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the bus was going in what direction?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. West.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, now, tell me what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And, after we got past Akard, at Murphy&mdash;I figured it out.
Let's see. I don't know for sure. Oswald got on. He looks like a maniac. His
sleeve was out here [indicating]. His shirt was undone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are indicating a sleeve of a shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was unraveled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Was a hole in it, hole, and he was dirty, and I didn't look at
him. I didn't want to know I even seen him, and I just looked off, and then
about that time the motorman said the President had been shot, and I sit&mdash;when
I go to town I sit this way on the bus. The motorman is right there
[indicating], and I sit right there so that I can get off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean&mdash;where do you sit with reference to the motorman, one
seat or two seats behind him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't&mdash;the motorman is here, and I sit across in the seat
across the way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on this day when you boarded the bus, is that the seat you
took?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I always did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would that be the first seat on the right-hand side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. First seat on the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Side seat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oh, it is a side seat? Was that side seat so that you were facing
the motorman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When Oswald got on, you then weren't facing him, were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; but I saw that it was him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How close did he pass to you as he boarded the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Just in front of me. Just like this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just a matter of a foot or two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he got on the bus, did he say anything to the motorman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, the motorman? I think&mdash;I don't know. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where did he sit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He sat about halfway back down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On what side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. On the same side I was on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Same side? Did you look at him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he look at you as he went by? Did he look at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know. I didn't look at him. That is&mdash;I was just&mdash;he
looked so bad in his face, and his face was so distorted.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have a hat on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what color shirt did he have on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He had a brown shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And unraveled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Hole in his sleeve right here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which is the elbow of the sleeve? That is, you pointed to the
elbow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, it is.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And that would be which elbow, right or left elbow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have anything on. Was the shirt open or was it buttoned?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; all the buttons torn off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he have on underneath that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the color of any undershirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Notice the color of his pants?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes, they were gray, and they were all ragged in here
[indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Around where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. At the seam.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At the waist?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. At the waist, uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was the shirt tucked beneath the belt in his pants, or outside
the belt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he had it in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had it tucked in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; it was tucked in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. So, that the belt of the pants was outside the shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you say the motorman said something?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Motorman said, "Well, the President has been shot," and I say&mdash;so,
and the woman over&mdash;we all got to talking about four of us sitting around
talking, and Oswald was sitting back there, and one of them said, "Hope they
don't shoot us," and I said, "I don't believe that&mdash;it is&mdash;I don't believe it.
Somebody just said that."</p>

<p>And it was too crowded, you see, and Oswald had got off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far had he been on the bus before he got off? Until the time
he got on until the time he got off?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. About three or four blocks.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything to the motorman when he got off?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. They say he did, but I don't remember him saying anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever see the motorman give him a transfer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't pay any attention but I believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, what do you mean he&mdash;you believe he did? Did you remember
seeing him get on or are you telling me something you read in the newspapers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I don't remember. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you pay any attention at that time as to whether he did,
or did not get a transfer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, did you look at him as he got off the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I sure didn't. I didn't want to know him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you think you got enough of a glimpse of him to be able to
recognize him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think you might be mistaken?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't look very carefully, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I just glanced at him, and then looked the other way
and I hoped he didn't see me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, are there two exits from the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The middle of the bus, and front of the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which exit did he leave?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Front.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. By the motorman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh, by the motorman.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody else get off at that time when he got off?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, not then, but there was a lady sitting right across, she
wanted to go to the train station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. To the what station?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Train station, and she was worried about trying to get off,
you know, trying to get there, and then we were hearing her, and I said, "Well,
why don't you walk over there. It's just a little ways." Because the crowd
was so bad we still didn't know the President had been killed, and finally she
got off, but I think it was&mdash;it was before&mdash;I mean after Oswald did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did she ask for a transfer?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; she had the man give her one, because she caught the
bus before she got to the train station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How do you know that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I saw her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You saw her catch another bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. She got on when we did. She rode a block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did anybody get off when the lady got off? Anybody that was
going to the train station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there traffic? Was the traffic heavy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, it was awful in the city, and then they had roped off that
around where the President was killed, shot, and we were the first car that
come around there, and then all of us were talking about the man, and we were
looking up to see where he was shot and looking&mdash;and then they had one man
and taking him, already got him in jail, and we got&mdash;"Well, I am glad they
found him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were looking up at where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. At where the boy was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean the Texas Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes, uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. School Book Depository?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh, because we were right four blocks from there, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me the location of the bus with reference to a cross
street on Elm where Oswald got off?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I can't, because they have changed that street, so, they
have torn down things and I don't go to town very much now and so I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was it in the middle of the block, or at a regular bus stop?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, they said it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I want to know what you remember.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember whether it was a regular bus stop or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did Oswald get on at a regular bus stop?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't pay any particular attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember anyone knocking on the door, and as a result,
the motorman opened the front door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are not able to say whether Oswald got on at a regular bus
stop, or at a point between blocks?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you are not able to tell us whether he got off at regular bus
stops, or between?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, had the bus gone as far as Lamar Street, when Oswald got off?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes. No; I think before we got to Lamar Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Close to Lamar?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes, close.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How close?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I couldn't say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Within a half block, or block?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; within a block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. About a block from Lamar, you think?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was approaching Lamar, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you first notify the police that you believe you'd seen
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. When I got home, first thing I did I went next door and told
them the President had been shot, and so she turned on the radio and I went in
and called my son and said the President had been shot, and he said, "Why, he
has got killed." Well, I turned on the radio&mdash;television&mdash;and we heard ambulances
and going around and them, and so, I didn't pay any attention. I wanted
to hear about the President and there was a little boy came in that room in the
back and he turned it on, and we listened and hear about Mr. Tippen [sic]
being shot, and it didn't dawn on me, and I said&mdash;told his name as Oswald.
I don't&mdash;didn't mean anything to me, so, I wanted to hear about the President,
only one I was interested in, so, he went on back to work and they kept
talking about this boy Oswald and had on a brown shirt, and all of a sudden,
well, I declare, I believe that this was this boy, and his name was Oswald&mdash;that
is&mdash;give me his right name, you know, and so, about an hour my son came
home, and I told him, and he immediately called the police and told them,
because we wanted to do all we could, and so, I went down the next night. He
took me down, and I made a statement to them, what kind of&mdash;Secret Service
man or something down there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. At the police station.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Uh-huh. Now, did you ever see Oswald in a lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ever show you pictures?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; showed me pictures of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But didn't show you Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Never did see Oswald after he was arrested?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Not after he got off the bus; no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But, you looked at the pictures of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Showed you the pictures of Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. The man down at the police station, he had a picture of him
with a gun, and said, "Do you recognize him?"</p>

<p>And I said, "Yes; it is Oswald." That is the one that I remember him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you know the name of the man who showed you the picture of
the man with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I am so bad about names.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there one man or more than one man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, about a dozen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oh, a dozen men?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. There sure was a lot of them. Two Secret Service men, and
two to do this, and oh, I had interviewed about 9 or 10 or 12, plenty of them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I have got a piece of clothing here, which is <span class="locked">marked&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Commission Exhibit 150.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This is a <span class="locked">shirt&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That is it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What do you mean by "that is it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Because they brought it out to the house and showed it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I know. What do you mean by "this is it?"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, because I can recognize it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Recognize it as what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes, sir; see there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes. You tell me what do you see here? What permits you to
recognize it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I recognize&mdash;first thing I notice the elbow is out and then I
saw&mdash;when the man brought it out and let me see it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No, I am talking about&mdash;I am showing you this shirt now, and
you said, "That is it." You mean&mdash;What do you mean by "that is it"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That is the one he had out there that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who had it out there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Some Secret Service man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He brought it out. Now, I am&mdash;you have seen this shirt then
before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was brought out by the Secret Service man and shown to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen the shirt before that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he had it on, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who had it on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oswald had it on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oswald had it on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, what is there about the shirt that makes you believe that this
is the shirt that Oswald had on when he was on the bus? What is there about
it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, let's see the front of it. Yes. See all this [indicating]?
I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me what you see there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I saw the&mdash;no; not so much that. It was done after&mdash;that is
the part I recognize more than anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are pointing to a hole in the right elbow?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I&mdash;What do you mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. When he had it on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Before he was shot? Yes; I remember it being brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You remember the shirt being brown.</p>

<p>Was it this color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; it was that color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In other words, when you remember that you have seen something
<span class="locked">before&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. In order to convince me that you did see it before you've got to
tell me what there is about it that is the same, you see. Now, you try to
convince me, or tell me why it is that you believe that this is the shirt that
Oswald had on when you saw him on the bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I would say it was. That <span class="locked">hole&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mostly the hole in the right sleeve?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What about the color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I remember the color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is a similar color, isn't it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; same color.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Same color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think that is the shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; it is the shirt.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen him wear this shirt before, when he was around
your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. First time you ever saw the shirt was when you saw him on the
bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have two exhibits here. One Commission Exhibit 157. Exhibit
157, and Commission 156, both pants. Have you ever seen either one of those
before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Now, is that long pants?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes; this is 157.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, that is not the ones he had on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That is not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; it was ragged up at the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. This other pair of pants, 156, does that look like any of the pants
he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That must have been it, but seemed like it was ragged up at
the top.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But, you think 156 may have been the pair of pants he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You think 157&mdash;don't pay any attention to the fact that it is cut
up&mdash;does 157 look anything like the pants he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't think so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I have no more questions to ask you now, Mrs. Bledsoe, but
Mr. Jenner will ask you some questions.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I will get up here close so you will hear me all right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I would like to go back to the day that he came to your home
on the 7th of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You were out in your backyard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And did he come back there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a bell on your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He knocked at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He knocked at the door and you heard him knock at the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And I went around the front.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your home is all at one level?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, you walked through your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I went through the yard and come around from the back
to the front yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you saw a young man at the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How was that young man dressed on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't remember what he had on. Didn't pay any attention.
He was clean and that's all you see, but I didn't know what color the pants
were and what kind of shirt it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, did he have a suit on or sportscoat, or just his shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Just the shirt. It was hot weather. October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you recall&mdash;did he have a tie on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The shirt, that was open at the front?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes, it wasn't those short shirts. I don't know what kind it
was. I didn't pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And this was a Monday morning.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Monday afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Monday afternoon. Did he have a hat on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he&mdash;did he have any luggage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; had one bag, I don't know whether it was a duffel or
what, but then he went on and got another one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, if you will permit me to stay with what he had when
you first saw <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You call on your recollection and tell me all you can tell me
about the bag he had at that time, its size, its shape. In another connection,
Mrs. Bledsoe, it is prior events that are important to us. If we can possibly
find out or get as accurate a description as you can give us. Sit there relaxed
and tell us what you remember about this bag, what size it was; what shape
it was; whether it was hard; whether it was soft, what color it was.</p>

<p>Was it zippered? How was it fastened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know whether it was zippered or not. But seems to
me like it was, though.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just start from the beginning and tell us what you remember
about the bag that he had when you first saw him at the door.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, it was just a blue&mdash;like a canvas bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Canvas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And, I don't know whether it was zippered or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't recall a zippered sort of bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't even look. It was about that long, I guess [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You are indicating about 26 inches?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About that long.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Then, he had some things on his back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you mind if we stuck with the bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, it was 26 inches long and you think it was canvas, and
you think it was blue in color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What was its shape? Was it a round sort of soft kind of bag
or was it&mdash;did it have firm, stiff sides? Was it rectangular?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I couldn't say. Couldn't say. Didn't pay any attention
to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your recollection does serve you that it was not what we would
call a suitcase?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; looked like an inexpensive bag of some kind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your memory doesn't serve you that there was any sort of
zipper thing, and you do seem to have a reasonably firm recollection that the
color of it was blue?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did it have a handle on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he picked it <span class="locked">up&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, that <span class="locked">is&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I was trying to get an idea, and well&mdash;I have a coat here, and
using it for purposes of illustration, when he picked up the bag by the handles
did the bag sag, or was it firm?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't pay any attention. Didn't pay a bit of attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, I notice from your testimony that he also had, on this
occasion, at this time, in addition to the canvas bag, blue in color, he had some
things over his arm, or over his shoulder?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. On a coathanger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had some articles of clothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. On coathangers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On coathangers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were those draped back over the shoulder or arm, or was
he holding them by the hooks or hooks on the hangers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I think he had them on coathangers, just&mdash;I guess&mdash;I don't
know&mdash;he was standing there. I don't have no idea.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just how he was carrying them, you are uncertain, but you
are certain that he had articles of clothing on hangers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. On coathangers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were&mdash;would they be wooden coathangers or the metal?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Metal ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. The type you get when you send clothes to the cleaners and
they come back on these wire, metal hangers, what&mdash;was that the type?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I imagine. I couldn't tell. Now, I&mdash;no; I didn't pay
any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your recollection serves you now that there were hangers, but
you cannot recall whether they were the wire type or whether they were
wooden?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. When he left, he just carried them off. I never did look at
his clothes at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You impress me as a lady that wouldn't be fussing around?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't care enough about it. All I wanted him to do was
rent the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, you had a discussion, and you rented the room to him for
$7 for that week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he paid you then and there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In cash?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; and I gave him a receipt on this book.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, he then left your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say anything about why he was leaving?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He went to the grocery store. No, no; first he went to get
his other bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Didn't say anything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you come to know that he went to get another bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He didn't say&mdash;he just went off.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He just turned around without any leave taking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; because he was not a man to talk, you know, what I got
out of him, I had to get it out of him, because it was hard to&mdash;because I wanted
to see what kind of a person he was, and it was hard to get, you know, to judge
him in such a short time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you completed the transaction about his renting the room
and you got your $7, he paid it to you, so it was agreed he had the room for a
week, did he go in and look at the room before he paid you the $7?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He was in the room, and I was at the door, and he looked at
it and I said, $7, so, he took it and give me the money all in ones, $7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Seven $1 bills?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Seven $1 bills, and then he come over to my room and I&mdash;he
wrote it down, and it is a good thing I had him write it, because I am kind
of nervous, and I don't write so well, see, and he put it down on that, and that&mdash;and
so, that is&mdash;this is in September, but <span class="locked">anyway&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes; I appreciate that.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. <span class="locked">October&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Let me ask her this question about that bag, if it was puffed
out, or approximately what shape it was, also, as to any further conversation that
she had as to his background, how much she knows. If you are interested. You
might not be.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Mr. Robert Davis of the attorney general's office of Texas
has come in, and I am not seeking to press you, but we have some problems of
the highest degree of exactitude that we can obtain. And at the risk of boring
you, I would like to go back to that bag again.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, that; I didn't pay much attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When you first saw him at the door at your front of your
home, he had the bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it resting on the porch, or was he standing before the door
with bag in hand when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I come around the house, you see, and I don't know. I didn't
pay&mdash;I don't know, couldn't tell you whether he was carrying it or what, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
he did have these things on his shoulder, on his hangers. It&mdash;maybe had it
sitting down, I don't know. I guess he did. I didn't pay any attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And at that point you were asking why he was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he asked me if I had a room for rent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And I said, "Yes," and I thought, "Well, are you married?"
And he said, "Yes," <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You asked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You inquired of him as to his history?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did you inquire of him, and what did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I wanted to find out something about him, and he said,
"Well, I just want the room for a week or two, because I am going to get a
job and then I will have my wife here."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He told you at that time and informed you that he was unemployed?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he would be seeking work?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he said that he was going to bring his wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And&mdash;when and if he obtained employment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And so, that give me a lead, something to talk about, and I
said, "Well, what kind of work do you do?</p>

<p>"Oh, I do electronics," he said, and I said, "Well, there is some good jobs
because you are young, and you can get a good job a young man like you."</p>

<p>And then went on. Then something about him being in the Marines, and I
said, "Well, that is wonderful. My son was in the Navy."</p>

<p>And talking about him, you know, just getting to know him, and&mdash;but,
"here is a picture of my wife, and picture of the girl, and the baby."</p>

<p>And I said, "Oh, she has got a baby, hasn't she?"</p>

<p>And he said, "Yes."</p>

<p>And everything he said, I had to pull it out of him to talk about something
for him to say what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, he volunteered the picture of his wife and child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; he did that. Showed me that picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was that an ordinary snapshot picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh. It was in his billfold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Took it out of his billfold?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, sir; it was in the billfold. Just showed it in the billfold.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. I have a billfold here. Was it this type?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; it was something else. Don't seem like it was like that.
Seemed like it opened this other way, <span class="locked">I&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. This?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I think it was like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he carry it in his trouser pocket, coat pocket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't pay any attention where he had it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What other inquiries did you make of him to become better
acquainted and find out about him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He said he had been in the Marines and I thought that was a
pretty good recommendation, and I said, "Well, you won't have any trouble
at all getting any job."</p>

<p>And so, the next morning I was helping him looking for a job.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, pardon me, if you will just stick to while you're at the
door now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">And&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Just one interruption, but find out if this conversation took
place at the door, or after he got in the room.</p>

<p>They are in this room, you see.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You went inside the house almost immediately?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he first made an inquiry?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you took him to show him the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And your inquiries were&mdash;with respect to his history were in
the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he showed you the picture while you were in the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And I take it, am I correct, when you went into the room he had
that bag, and he had the articles of clothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And had them with him, didn't leave them on the porch?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he do with the bag when he entered the room? Did
he put it down on the floor?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didn't pay any attention? What did he do with the articles of
clothing on the hangers?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I wasn't paying any attention to it. I guess he hung them up.
Just a young boy, and I was trying to see if he was clean, and if he was very
intelligent, and he was going to go to work, so, I didn't have too much to work
on. Told me he had a nice wife, so, I didn't have anything to say.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When your son was in the Navy, did he have a duffelbag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No. Now, it was so long ago&mdash;it was&mdash;I don't know whether
he did. I don't think he did. He didn't. He was an instructor at TI.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he stationed here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, TI. Treasure Island.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Oh, Treasure Island. How long did this discussion with him in
the room take?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, I guess 10 minutes because those&mdash;he was&mdash;you know, old
people, they want to get you out of the way. They don't want to listen to you,
but I wanted to find out, so, I think I maybe asked him too many questions, but
I wanted him to say something to me and he said something about his&mdash;I said,
"Do you have a family here," and he said, "Yes, my family lives here."</p>

<p>Well, he wouldn't say his mother or anything, and I didn't ask him everything.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. All right.</p>

<p>(Discussion off the record.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you notice anything in addition to the hangers with respect
to these clothes? Were the articles of clothing enclosed in any kind of a bag or
paper, plastic, or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, just on hangers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just on hangers.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. But I didn't pay any attention to what kind of&mdash;I think maybe
a coat. I don't know what it was, a sweater or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you see how many articles of clothing were there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, about four.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And none of them was enclosed in any kind of a container,
plastic or otherwise?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was he pleasant during all of the conversation you had with
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Was the first day. Next day didn't talk any more. I didn't
talk to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. As soon as he&mdash;recalling to mind that he paid you the $7.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did any further conversation take place after he paid you the
$7?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; that is when he asked where the grocery store was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. What else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, he didn't say anything about going to get the rest of his
things. I think that he must have been&mdash;said that after he came back with the
other bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Must have said what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Where was the grocery store, after he come back and got the
<span class="locked">other&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, your recollection presently serves you that he paid you the
$7 and no further conversation took place?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He turned and left the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I&mdash;he was&mdash;I was in the room, I just walked out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You walked out after the transaction, financially, was complete?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I went and he paid&mdash;he had already paid me but I wanted him
to put his name on here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On your register?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. On this [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He did <span class="locked">that&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. In your presence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; in the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your recollection was that he wrote the words "Lee Oswald"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then did he leave your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Without saying anything to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was gone&mdash;did he return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; within about 40 minutes, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And he was gone about 40 minutes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And got the rest of his things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When he returned did you see him before he entered your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you have a recollection of having seen him before he entered
his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you become aware of the fact he had returned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I must have heard him, or he might have come in and
put his milk in the icebox.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, he didn't get the milk, as far as I recall, until you'd advised
him where the grocery store was.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was after he had returned from <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. From <span class="locked">the&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. After this 40-minute interval? I am just sticking for the
moment to the time that he returned to your home after 40 minutes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He had put his name in your register and in your presence, in
the living room, and turned and left your home and returned in 40 minutes;
now, is that right? It's that point that I am concentrating on. When did
you become aware that he had returned on that occasion and how?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I don't know&mdash;I guess he come and put the things in
the icebox. I don't even remember where I was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see. So, that you didn't see him return to your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't see him come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Didn't see him come in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you didn't know what he had with him at that point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. To the best of your ability where was he in your home when
you became aware of his presence on his return after that 40 minutes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I must have been in the kitchen and he came back there and
put the milk in, I guess.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he have milk with him after he returned that 40 minutes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, not the 40 minutes. That was the bag.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. See, this is what I'm trying to concentrate on for the moment,
before you get the milk. And I am trying to take it sequentially. He paid
the $7 and signed the register in your living room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And without any further words to you he turned and left your
home, is that accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; that's about right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He returned in 40 minutes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, sticking right to that point, when did you become aware
of the fact that he was then back in your home, that is, at that point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That he&mdash;he hadn't gotten the milk yet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; this is when he first returned.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I don't know. I was just around the house. I didn't
pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, I take it, then, when he made that first trip back, you
didn't see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know what he had with him on that occasion?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I guess he had the bag, didn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I want to stick with what you knew at that instant of time.
What you found out afterwards, I'll go into that in a moment.</p>

<p>You didn't see him return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You don't know what he had with him when he returned?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At that instance, because you didn't see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, you were aware; now, you became aware of the fact that
he did return?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a conversation with him at that point?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. When did you become aware and I gather from your earlier
testimony you became aware that he had brought that into your home, or there
was in your home some additional luggage. When you first saw him he had
this soft canvas bag, or canvas bag, whether it was soft or not that is uncertain.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And then you became aware later that day that there was another
piece of luggage, and, am I correct about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Now, I think he said he was going to get some more. He
was going to get some more and he had some boots, too, in his hand. I&mdash;maybe
he brought those the last time. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What kind of boots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, they looked like they were about up to here [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Up to the knee?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; about there [indicating].</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Oh,&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. There.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just a little above the ankle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About 3 inches above the ankle?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know what they used them for.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they cowboy boots.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; it wasn't cowboy boots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Were they canvas, leather, or rubber?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; just leather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Heavy-soled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Heavy-soled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Heavy-soled. Rubber soles?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, no; leather.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Any hobnails in them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Hard heel or flat heel? I mean, flat sole and heel?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, they had a heel, too. I remember them having that. He
must have brought those in when he brought those the last time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do not recall his having the boots at the time you first&mdash;at
the first time you talked to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I don't believe he did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, you became aware of the boots afterward?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. At, or about, or after the time he returned from this 40-minute
absence?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And was it at the time you noticed the boots, did you also notice
that he had additional items of luggage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, he went to get the luggage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I don't know whether he did or not. I know he&mdash;I don't
know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you have a thought in mind when he left after he paid you
the $7 and signed your register that he was going somewhere to obtain additional
articles of clothing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I thought that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You thought that? He didn't say anything to you about that,
however?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he didn't say anything. Didn't talk much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is clear in your mind that he just turned around after you
finished the transaction and left and returned in 40 minutes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I thought he said he had to get some groceries, but maybe that
was after he got the luggage, I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You had become aware that afternoon that he had additional
articles of luggage?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Come in about 3, about 4 he got the rest of the luggage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, this additional article of luggage, would you describe it,
as compared <span class="locked">with&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't pay <span class="locked">any&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Please. As compared with this canvas bag, blue in color, that
you just told me about?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't pay no attention to it at all. It was just a piece
of luggage.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, was it <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What I would call a suitcase or what you might call a suitcase?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; it wasn't a regular suitcase, but just something inexpensive,
just something the boys have, and I didn't pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it hard-sided?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; it was a&mdash;you know, it was weak, you know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Uh-huh. It was weak. Was it strong enough so that it had
a rectangular shape?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You know what I mean by suitcase?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. It is reasonably firm and hard, and has a handle on it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; it wasn't that way. One of those inexpensive kind of
things, but I don't know whether it was canvas or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was it firmer in shape than the canvas bag you have described
to me that he had earlier?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No. Well, I think it was chuck full.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You know it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh. It was, I remember. I <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Do you remember the color?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No. One of them was blue, and I don't know which one or
anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I see.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Let me ask her something.</p>

<p>Mary, would it help you to remember this if you would just begin, you were
out in the yard, and you went around and interviewed this man there, did you
stand in the yard, or go in your room and talk? Did he put up his things then
before he came across the hall to talk to you? When did he ask you about
groceries? After he signed your register did he go back in his room and hang
his clothes up, or what happened? Would it help if you just sit here idly without
anybody asking you questions and see? Did you go back out in the yard
after he paid you the money, and while he was gone&mdash;if you can, just retrace
your steps without anybody interrupting you. Could you begin and go again
out in the yard, and went around and saw this man here, and he told you he
wanted to rent a room, whether you stood on the porch and talked to him, or
whether he brought his things and you went on and showed him the room? How
far is the room from where your front door was? If you go down a hall, how
far? Did you go over there and talk to him and make arrangements about the
rent of the room? Did he hang up his clothes while he was in the room?</p>

<p>Did he&mdash;if you can just trace your steps and give it to him. I ask you to
do that, and I know it is confusing, but that's all he wants.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I am getting tired.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All he wants is the truth, and I thought maybe you might,
for the sake of the record, you <span class="locked">know&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I would have&mdash;we have said most everything.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. I know it, but just do it one more time. The man was standing
at your front <span class="locked">door&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I am getting tired, because I have had a stroke, you see.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did you go back out in the yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I stayed in.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did he leave your house twice? Now, you said he went and
got a bag and brought it back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; he did, brought back the bag.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Then he went back again?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. How long was he&mdash;all I want to know is just, if you can
just tell that in your own words without any questions. Could you just do
that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I'd rather they asked, <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. I know, but it is hard for them to ask these particular questions,
because they don't know exactly what happened. All they want to do
is to say that you were in the room with him, and put this little bag down
and hung up his clothes, and came across the hall and signed the register, see.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, that's all. I don't know whether he put his clothes
and what in the other room. I don't know whether he put his <span class="locked">bag&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Was there a closet in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Well, were you with him when he put the clothes in the
closet, or did you go on across the hall and leave him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, no; I didn't pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did you leave his presence&mdash;Mary, pardon me, I am not&mdash;this
is not for the record.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. No; that's fine, leave it on the record.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right. When the man was on your front porch.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. He had a blue bag in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. And you don't know whether it was round or bulging, you
just don't know?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. You don't know whether it had a long strap or a little handle,
do you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I think it had a handle.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. But, it wasn't one you sling over your shoulder?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right, can you go ahead?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Clothes were sort of hanging over here [indicating].</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Uh-huh. Not covered or anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. You couldn't tell anybody about what color the clothes were,
could you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did you stand in the yard and talk to the young man? Or
immediately go into the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I immediately&mdash;I was talking to him, but I had to go
in immediately, because he wanted to see the room.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right. How far is it, Mrs. Bledsoe, from where you met
this man at the front door until you showed him the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, it is about 25 foot, and all that time I had to size him
up, you see.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. You were talking to him as you went down the hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes; <span class="locked">getting&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Is that where you learned that he was married, as you were
walking down the hall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he told me he was married before we went in the house.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right, then, when you got to the room, did you both walk
inside the room, or stand in the door and talk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I stood in the door, and he went in and looked at it and took it.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did he keep his clothes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I didn't pay any attention.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. When he was talking to you, you don't know what he did,
just stood and talked to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did you leave his presence before he came into your room
and signed the register?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Now, that, <span class="locked">Melody&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Were you with him? And took him into the room, <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Says, "I'll take the room."</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did you leave him in the room and you go on across to your
room? How far is your room from where you rented his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Right next to it. No; he came on in, he came on back behind me.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. He never left your presence from the time you went in this
room until he came over here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right, did he put his things in your room&mdash;or bring them
with him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he left them in the room.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right, you don't know where he put them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; didn't pay any attention to him.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Is there a closet in that room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. You don't remember whether he hung his clothes in the closet?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. But, he left and came over where you were and signed your
register, and then did he go back into his room or go down the hall and leave
the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, went back in his room.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right. You don't know how long he stayed in his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Now, before he left your room, did he tell you anything about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
going and getting additional luggage, or did you know when he was leaving the
room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I didn't know. He said he was going to get some groceries
but it might have been that he said that he was going, I don't know. I don't
know.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Was it when he signed the register that he asked you about
the grocery store, or later?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Later.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right. Then you were in your room when he went back
in his room. Did you see him leave his room and go out of the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Then where did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Lord have mercy. I don't know.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did you go back out in the yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I don't think I went into the yard. I was fooling around
the house.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right, how far from your room is your kitchen?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, Lord. It is a long ways. It is clear across the living
room and dining room and the kitchen is right there [indicating].</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right, but your room is right next to the room you rented
to this man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. When did you have knowledge that he was back in his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, when&mdash;I guess when he brought these&mdash;brought the
milk in.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. How could he go to the grocery store and get milk unless
he had already asked you where the grocery store was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I guess he did, he had already.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Okay, then, it was on his return from getting the bag that
he asked you about the grocery store, is that right? Or do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, yes; it wasn't anything said about this when he rented&mdash;about
eating. Just&mdash;he just rented the room, and not to eat in there.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Now when you had some kind of knowledge, as you just said,
could you hear him back in his room, or could you see him back in his room
after he left the first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I heard him.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did he come in and talk to you before he left your house
the second time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; he never did talk to me at all. He didn't talk.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. The only conversation you had with this Mrs.&mdash;with this
Mr. Oswald was when he came and rented the room and signed the register?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And what I got out of him. That's all I could get.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Now; did you get any information out of him after he signed
the register?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, the next day.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. I am talking about this one day.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; didn't get much.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Then all of your conversation that you had this Monday
that he rented that room took place at one time, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Now, he came back, and for some reason you knew he was
in there. When did he leave your house the second time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. When he went to get the groceries.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Well, when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I don't know.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Was he&mdash;when he went to leave, did he come in and say,
"I'm going to get some groceries." Did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. You evidently told him about the grocery store the first time
when he signed the register and your conversation with <span class="locked">him&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't either.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Well, you just said you had one conversation with him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
you had no other conversation with him. Now, just remember these facts that
you had no conversation with him after he paid you the money and signed the
register.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I wouldn't say, because I don't know what he did. I
don't remember.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. All right, how long after&mdash;when he brought his bag back and
put it in this room, how long did he stay in that room until he left to go to the
grocery store, if that is where he went?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Was that the first when he went and got the other bag?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, 20 or 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did he go and use the telephone, or just stay in his room all
that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No, didn't use the phone until&mdash;I think he used it after.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Did he use your telephone on Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. After the, yes; after he got everything settled, I think he did.
Two or three times every day. Called his wife, supposed to be.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. You don't know who he called?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I don't know who he called.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. But, you don't know anything at all about when you gave
him this information about the grocery store? We are just trying to get the
order here in which this happened, Mrs. Bledsoe, is all, if you can just remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, Lord.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. That is the reason I asked you if you could, to write these
things down.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. I am sorry, but I thought in&mdash;I might help you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he make a telephone call after he became settled?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the 8th of October?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I wouldn't say for sure, but I guess he did, because he called
his wife, supposedly&mdash;supposed to have been all the time, but in the morning he
called some people about jobs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Because he talked on the phone and talked gruff, talked gruff
to those on the phone, and talked about a job. I heard that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Then, one of the occasions when the gentleman interviewed
you&mdash;were Secret Service and FBI people&mdash;there is a notation that you recalled
that on Monday afternoon that he did call his wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, does that refresh your recollection, that he did call her
the same day that he moved in here <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I guess he did, uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And, were you aware of the fact that he was using the telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Oh, I told him he could use the phone to get him a job and
call his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And were you aware of any occasion on Monday when you had
your own mental conception that he was actually talking with his wife?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, it didn't&mdash;I wasn't interested at all. He&mdash;I wasn't&mdash;I
didn't think about it at all. When I got interested is when he called, talking in
that foreign language.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, the first time you heard him talking in the foreign language
was when?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. As well as I can guess, it was a Wednesday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Wednesday afternoon, but he came <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, so you assume that the other calls he made on Monday,
since he did not, I take it, did not speak in a foreign language, or you didn't
hear him speak in a foreign language on Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And you didn't hear him do so on Tuesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. First time you heard him to do that was Wednesday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. <span class="locked">Well&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. Ask her if she ever heard him talk to anybody on the telephone
in English. That is <span class="locked">what&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Well, I have assumed that you did hear him talk with people
on the telephone using the English language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, was about jobs, about getting a job. He called people
to get jobs, and then he would become almost mad, and sometimes he was mad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I don't know, but he was mad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. About what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. About what they were talking about. He would get in a bad
humor, and then the day he made that call, <span class="locked">he&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which call?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. That call.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Wednesday? The call in which he spoke in a foreign language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. He was real mad.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. He was angry with the person to whom he was speaking over the
telephone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. But, you couldn't understand what he was saying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. So, you don't know whether he was angry with the person, or
angry with someone else and explaining it to the person on the phone about
something in anger?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I know he talked in a&mdash;he talked in a, I guess it was a foreign
language, and I don't know what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Just sounded irritated?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was there ever an occasion when you saw him in possession,
either in his room, or carrying a long object wrapped in paper or a blanket <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or something as long as 45 inches long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Seven or eight inches wide?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Didn't have anything like that with him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Anything that you thought could be curtain rods <span class="locked">or&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Or shades that are on the spring, did he ever have any package
that looked as though that sort of thing might be contained in it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You saw nothing of that nature in his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Now, would you describe the room? Was it tastefully decorated
or&mdash;shades, curtains? There was no need for him to have any&mdash;bring anything
in to decorate that room, was there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did he do so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Brought nothing in of that nature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. And there was no discussion with you on that subject?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You do have a distinct recollection, do you, that he was there on
Friday, that would be the 11th, I think?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Friday. That is the day that he stayed in his room all day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Stayed in his room all day long?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Just went to the bathroom and came back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. That was Friday, October 11?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Uh-huh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. On the 12th, that would be Saturday the 12th of October, did he
receive any phone calls?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Would you tell me about that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I think he called somebody&mdash;somebody called him, and I
judged it was his wife.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you answer the phone, or did he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; my son answered.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Your son answered the phone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. And he called him to the phone, and seemed like that she was
going to have a child <span class="locked">and&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you gather this from what you heard him say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. From what they said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. From his end of the conversation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. From him, and then I thought he was going to move, and you
see, I was tickled to death, so, then said, "Well, I will meet her," or, said that
he would meet her, said he would go to the hospital and meet her, see, but he
didn't never get to it, I judged that is what he said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard enough of the conversation that you have the recollection
that he said something about his wife possibly having to go to the hospital?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. For the delivery of her child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Was this the first time you had any knowledge that his wife was
with child?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Did you say anything about that to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. No; I didn't mention it. I never did mention about that man
talking to him either, because it wasn't any of my business.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. Which man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. This man who called and talked to him in the foreign language.
I never did see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. How did you know it was a man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Well, I just judged that it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You heard his end of the conversation? He was talking in a
foreign language?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. You assumed from that that whoever was on the other line was
likewise talking in a foreign language, and you assumed a man, though you
didn't know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I don't know, so, I didn't say that, because I don't know, but
I never did say anything about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. I believe that's about all I have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. What time is it? I'm tired.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It is 5 minutes until 11.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. I guess he is going to ask something, too, and I will be up
here at 12.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Mrs. Bledsoe, this deposition will be written up by the reporter,
and you can take it and look it over if you wish and change it in any way and
sign it, or if you wish to waive the signature we will have it written up and send
it to the Commission as it is.</p>

<p>Do you have any preference that way? Do you want her to waive the
signature?</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Douthit</span>. I think she can waive it. I don't see any reason for her to
sign it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then can we, on the advice of your attorney, will you waive the
signature?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bledsoe</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Fine. You will know that you won't be bothered any more then.</p>

<p>Thank you very much, Mrs. Bledsoe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenner</span>. We do want you to know that we appreciate your coming in.</p>

<h2 id="t428"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_WILLIAM_W_WHALEY" id="TESTIMONY_OF_WILLIAM_W_WHALEY">TESTIMONY OF WILLIAM W. WHALEY</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of William W. Whaley was taken at 1:50 p.m., on April 8, 1964,
in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and Ervay
Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Mr. David W. Belin, assistant counsel of the President's
Commission.</p>

<p class="p2">Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you want to stand and raise your right hand.</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I do, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you state your name, please.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. William W. Whaley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You live in Dallas, Mr. Whaley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You previously testified before the Commission in Washington,
is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now before you came to Washington, did you and I ever meet?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Your face is familiar, sir. I still can't tell you whether I
knew you here, or in Washington, or where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. You refresh my memory.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I will try to refresh your memory here. When did you come
to Washington, approximately?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, it's been about 2 or 3 weeks ago, sir. I don't remember
the exact date.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You testified before the President's Commission on the Assassination
of President Kennedy in Washington, did you not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now Mr. Ball and I were with you earlier today over the noon
hour, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That's correct, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Ball and I saw you in Washington, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Now I don't know if that is correct or not, but your face is
very familiar.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You think you have seen me before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It might have been in Washington when you were there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; it could have been.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Whaley, today at noon there were six people including yourself
that got in the car to travel that route that you drove a passenger on
November 22, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. One of them is sitting here in this room, Dr. Goldberg, over there.
Do you see him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you and I got in the car, and then Secret Service Agent
John Joe Hewlett. We drove in his car and he was the driver, wasn't he?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then there was Mr. Joe Ball, Joseph A. Ball, and then a Mr.
Davis, this tall light-haired person?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Davis is from the attorney general's office in Texas.</p>

<p>Now what is the fact as to whether or not we went to the Greyhound Bus
Depot here in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you point out the place where you said you picked up this
passenger?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We had a stopwatch, didn't we?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you directed us to take a certain route, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That's correct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was the route from the Greyhound Bus Depot that you
directed us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. On the right from the Greyhound and Lamar to Jackson; right
on Jackson and left at Austin and right at Wood.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Then left on Houston, which is the approach to the viaduct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do when you got to Houston?</p>

<p>You turned left?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I said west to Houston.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. You go on the approach past the Union Terminal and up the
ramp which is called the Houston Street viaduct.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. You run into Zangs Boulevard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far on Zangs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. To Beckley. Beckley crosses it.
We got to the intersection of Zangs and Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did we go about the speed you drove that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Almost. Going across the viaduct is just about the speed, but
he slowed down going up Zangs Boulevard. He slowed down a little slower than
I was going.</p>

<p>My normal rate of speed, I don't remember the exact speed I was traveling,
but I assume it was normal, because that is the way I travel all the time when
traffic is clear enough.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your normal rate of speed would be a little bit faster than the
rate that he took?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir. In other words, not enough to make over half a
minute difference in the timing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was traffic clearer on that particular day of November 22?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. It was extra clear, for some reason. That street was clear
except when I hit Beckley. When I hit Beckley, there was cars turning to the
left, and I had to stop for the light.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When we got to Beckley at noon today, or shortly thereafter,
the traffic light was green, but you told us you had stopped, so we waited through
the red light, did we not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then he turned on Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Heading south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when this man that you picked up on November 22 got into
your cab, where did he say he wanted to go?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. To the 500 block of North Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I will take you back to November 22.</p>

<p>You turned south on Beckley and then where did you go as you turned
south on Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I went right up on Beckley headed toward the 500 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. When I got to Beckley almost to the intersection of Beckley
and Neely, he said, "This will do right here," and I pulled up to the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that the 500 block of North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; that was the 700 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You let him out not at the 500 block but the 700 block of North
Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you crossed Neely Street yet when you let him off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far north of Neely street did you let the man off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. About 20 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you went down to the police station to identify this man?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw a lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what number he was in the lineup at all?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. There was four of them, sir, and from the right to the left,
he was No. 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Starting from the right to the left, from his right or your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. From your right, sir, which would have been his left. There
were numbers above their heads, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mr. Whaley, what number did you say the man was in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the right or from your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. From my left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No. 2?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. They brought out four of them and stood them up there, and
he was under No. 2. I mentioned he was the third one that come out. There
were four and all handcuffed together.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you sign an affidavit for the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I will hand you a document which I am calling Whaley Deposition
Exhibit A, and ask you to say if your signature appears on there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; that is my signature.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I notice in the statement there it says that you traveled Wood
Street to Houston Street, turned left and went over the viaduct to Zangs
Boulevard. You see that statement there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "Traveled Zangs to Beckley and turned left and traveled on
Beckley until I reached the 500 block of North Beckley. When I got in the
500 block of North Beckley he said this will do and I stopped."</p>

<p>Now is that what you told them on that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; that is what I told them on that day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, was that the fact that you drove until you reached the
500 block, or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir, I didn't drive until I reached the 500 block. I drove
until I reached Beckley and Neely. If you would be in my place when they
took me down there, when they had to force their way through the reporters
to get me in the office, they wrote that up, and I signed it, because I told them
that the man said he wanted to go to the 500 block of North Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now in here it says, "The No. 3 man who I now know
is Lee Harvey Oswald was the man who I carried from the Greyhound Bus
Station * * *"</p>

<p>Was this the No. 3 or the No. 2 man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I signed that statement before they carried me down to see
the lineup. I signed this statement, and then they carried me down to the lineup
at 2:30 in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You signed this affidavit before you saw the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, now, let's get this straight. You are getting me confused.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, I will put it this way. There was an FBI reporter, FBI
interviewer with you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes, sir; there was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And there was an interview with the Dallas Police Department?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes. And Bill Alexander from the district attorney's office
was there, also.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, the last sentence.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Let me tell you how they fixed this up. They had me in the
office saying that. They were writing it out on paper, and they wrote it out
on paper, and this officer, Leavelle, I think that is his name, before he finished
and before I signed he wanted me to go with him to the lineup, so I went to
the lineup, and I come back and he asked me which one it was, which number
it was, and I identified the man, and we went back up in the office again, and
then they had me sign this. That is as near as I can remember.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
My recollection for that afternoon in that office was very disturbed because
everytime they would open the door, some flash camera would flash in your
face and everybody coming in and out and asking you questions.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean reporters?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I made this statement more to Bill Alexander, because I
tried to talk to him more. Everybody was trying to talk to me at once.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you saw the statement the first time, did you see the statement
before you went down to see the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No; I didn't see the statement. I don't think I did. I am not
for sure.</p>

<p>I think I signed it after I came back. It was on paper. They were writing
it up on paper.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They were writing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Before I left there, I signed this typewritten, because they had
to get, a stenographer typed it up. I had to wait.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But was this before or after you saw the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. After she typed it up. It was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is when I signed it, after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, when you signed it&mdash;what I want to know is, before you
went down, had they already put on there a statement that the man you saw
was the No. 3 man in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I don't remember that. I don't remember whether it said three
or two, or what.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they have any statements on there before you went down to the
lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I never saw what they had in there. It was all written out
by hand. The statement I saw, I think, was this one, and that could be writing.
I might not even seen this one yet. I signed my name because they said
that is what I said.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, Mr. <span class="locked">Whaley&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I know, sir, but I don't think you can understand what I had
to put up with that afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean with the press?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; with everything.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, I do understand, sir, and I appreciate that you were under
a great deal of pressure at that time, and I want to try and get at the actual
facts, and that is why we asked you to come back to testify again, because we
wanted to know basically whether or not the man that you drove in the cab got
off in the 500 block or the 700 block.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. The man I drove in the cab got off where I told you he got off,
this morning.</p>

<p>I picked him up, and I showed you where I picked him up, and the trip runs
95 cents on the meter. He gave me a dollar and got off and he never spoke
a word to me, except he wanted to go to 500 North Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember a woman coming up to the cab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; I remember that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What happened then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. The lady, I don't remember whether she was very old, but she
was middle-aged. She bent down and stuck in and said, "Can I have this
cab?" And he cracked the door open like he was going to get out. I thought
he was going to let her have it.</p>

<p>I told her there would be another one, and she said, "Would you please call
me one."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he say anything to the woman, that you can remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. When she wanted to know if she could have the cab, I don't
know, but I got a faint hunch he did tell her she could have this one, or
something like that. What it was, I was watching my left-hand side. I wanted
to pull out when the light changed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now when you saw a lineup down at the police <span class="locked">station&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He didn't have on the same clothes. He had on a white T-shirt
and black pants, and that is all he had on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember now whether the man that you saw there was
the No. 2 or the No. 3 man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I will admit he was No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No. 2 from your left, or from your right?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. He was the third man out in the line of four as they walked out
in a line. They put the first man out on the right, and the last one on my left,
and as near as I can remember, he was No. 2, but it was the man I hauled.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It says here the No. 3.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, I am not trying to mix nobody up. I'm giving it to you
the best of my ability.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Your memory right now is that it was the No. 2 man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is the way it is right now. I don't think it will change
again.</p>

<p>But on that afternoon, all I saw was the man that I hauled up there, and
they asked me which number he was, and I said No. 2. I am almost sure I did,
but I couldn't get up to swear to it that I did, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Just one more minute, if you would, please?</p>

<p>Mr. Whaley, earlier in your testimony here you said that Lee Harvey Oswald
was No. 3. Do you remember saying that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; but I meant that he was the third one out when they
walked out with him. I said from my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From your right he was No. 3?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What number was over his head?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, they&mdash;when they walked over the line and they stopped
him, No. 2 was over his head, but he was pulling on both of the other men on
each side and arguing with this detective, so he didn't stay under any certain
number.</p>

<p>He was moving like that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see him later on television?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You never did see his picture in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I saw his picture in the paper the next morning, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would have been Sunday morning, the 24th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I guess it was, if you say it was, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I don't want <span class="locked">to&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I don't want to get you mixed up and get your whole investigation
mixed up through my ignorance, but a good defense attorney could take me
apart. I get confused. I try to tell you exactly what happened, to the best
of my ability, when they brought Oswald out in the lineup of four. He was the
third man out. I don't know which way they count them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We don't want you to be concerned about affecting the investigation
one way or the other by what you say. What we want you to say is tell
us what you know, to the best of your recollection.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That is exactly what I am doing, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. What day of the week did you take this cab
passenger, on a Friday or Saturday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I would have to see my trip sheet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You don't remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it the day of the motorcade?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. The day of the President's parade, yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, was it that day that you went down to the police station
to see the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it the next day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The next day you went down to the Dallas Police Station and saw
a lineup of how many people?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Four people.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. These men came out and there were numbers above their heads?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. The numbers were stationary. Looked through a black silk
screen at them. In other words, they were very dim, the numbers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see as the number over the man that you identified
as having been in your cab that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see a picture of that man in the paper at any time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Saturday morning, sir; following the event on Friday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw his picture in the paper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that the same man that you identified as No. 2 in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever see his picture in the paper again?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; I take that back, sir. I saw the picture in the paper
when they had, when Ruby killed him at the time between the two detectives.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the man in connection with the Ruby matter with the two
detectives, did it have his name in the paper as Lee Harvey Oswald? Was his
name in the paper then when you saw his picture?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, I don't think they had it that way. I think they just had
it Oswald. I am not sure what they had under it. I am not for sure, but
I did see the picture.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that the same man you carried in your cab on Friday?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that the man you identified at the police station?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is your best recollection, if I understand it, that this was the
No. 2 man in the lineup?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That's right, sir. That was from the left now. No. 2 from my
left. I was facing him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Right. I mean correct. Now, your affidavit which is Whaley's
Deposition Exhibit A, the last sentence says, "The No. 3 man who I now know as
Lee Harvey Oswald was the man who I carried from the Greyhound bus station
to the 500 block of North Beckley." Now you say it was the No. 2 man
from your left, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. From my left. No. 3 from my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about whether or not you carried him to the 500 block of
North Beckley. Did you carry him there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir. That is where he asked me. That is where I put on
my trip sheet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had it on the trip sheet the 500 block of North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you put it on your trip sheet, before or after you let
him out?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. After, sir; a good while after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, see, sometimes when you are busy you make three or
four trips before you ever write one up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why didn't you put it on your trip sheet for 700 instead of 500
North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Because that is what he told me and that is what I remember
when I wrote the trip up. I imagine there were hundreds of trip sheets, because
people get off before they get where they are going. But I remember the thing
that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you first ascertain or start thinking about it that it was
the 700 block of North Beckley where you let him off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Well, when the FBI man got in my cab and he wanted to go
over the route.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. I don't know the exact date, sir, but it was the next week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In the next week you told the FBI that it was the 700 block?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; I don't recall. I know I took him to where I let him
out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You did?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever tell anyone it was the 700 block of North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir. I left it said just like I had it on my trip sheet.
Nobody else asked me about it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When we went out there today, when we started the stopwatch
from the Greyhound bus station to the 700 block of North Beckley, do you
know about how many minutes that was on the stop watch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. A little more than 5 minutes, between 5 and 6 minutes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would your trip that day, on November 22, have been longer or
shorter, or about the same time as the trip we took today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. It would be approximately the same time, sir, give or take a
few seconds, not minutes. Because the man drove just about as near to my
driving as possible. We made every light that I made, and we stopped on
the lights that I stopped on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let the record show that the stopwatch was 5 minutes and 30
seconds from the commencement of the ride to the end of the ride, and let
the record further show that Dr. Goldberg and Mr. Robert Davis from the
Texas attorney general's office and I walked back from the point where the
Deponent Whaley told us he let the passenger off at the residence at 1026
North Beckley, and that this walk took 5 minutes and 45 seconds.</p>

<p>And let the record further show that after visiting the rooming house at
1026 North Beckley&mdash;that is what I call the "long way around route,"&mdash;was
walked from 1026 North Beckley to the scene of the Tippit shooting, which took
17 minutes and 45 seconds at an average walking pace, and this route would
be to take Beckley to 10th Street and then turn on 10th Street toward Patton,
and this is not the most direct route. Rather, the most direct route would be
to take Beckley to Davis Street and then turn left or east on Davis, walking
a short block to Crawford, and taking Crawford to 10th, and then 10th east to
Patton, or taking Davis Street directly to Patton, and taking Patton down to
East 10th, and that the more direct nature of the later route appears from the
map which I believe is Commission's Exhibit No. 371, which is the Dallas
street map.</p>

<p>Mr. Whaley, is there anything else that you care to add, or can you add anything
else that might be helpful in this investigation?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. No, sir; I can't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. We sure appreciate all your help and taking the time to go over
the route today.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Thank you. I still would like to know where I knew you before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Sir, I don't know. Now, Mr. Whaley, if you like, you can come
back and read this deposition after it is typed, and sign it before you mail it to
Washington, or you can waive the signing of it. You have a right to read it
and sign it before it goes, or you can waive the reading of it and send it directly
to us in Washington.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Does it make any difference?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It does not make any difference.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. It will all be what you said and what she took down?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What you said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. Yes, sir; and what I said?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Whaley</span>. That will be all right. I will waive the signing of it.</p>

<h2 id="t431"><a name="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_EARLENE_ROBERTS" id="TESTIMONY_OF_MRS_EARLENE_ROBERTS">TESTIMONY OF MRS. EARLENE ROBERTS</a></h2>

<p>The testimony of Mrs. Earlene Roberts was taken at 4:10 p.m., on April 8,
1964, in the office of the U.S. attorney, 301 Post Office Building, Bryan and
Ervay Streets, Dallas, Tex., by Messrs. Joseph A. Ball and Samuel A. Stern,
assistant counsel of the President's Commission. Dr. Alfred Goldberg was
present.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Would you stand and take the oath?</p>

<p>Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give before the Commission
will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help
you God?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Will you state your name, please?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Mrs. Earlene Roberts.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what is your address?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. 5000 Tremont, now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You used to live at 1026 North Beckley, didn't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; I did.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Tell me something about yourself, Mrs. Roberts, where you were
born and where you have lived?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I was born in Nashville, Tenn., and my mother and father
moved to Tyler, Tex., and I was raised there and married a Dallas man.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you go to school in Tyler?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How far through school did you go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. To my sorrows, I got married in the ninth grade.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did&mdash;you got married in the ninth grade?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you get married in Dallas or in Tyler?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. In Tyler.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have some children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No; to my sorrows&mdash;I couldn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did you do in Tyler then&mdash;until you came to Dallas?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I was a PBX operator at the Hotel Blackstone. That's where
I met my husband.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long have you lived here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Since 1938.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of work have you done?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, until he passed away&mdash;I didn't work for I didn't have to.
He made me a good living, but since that time I have been&mdash;well, just, I guess
you would call it practical nursing or housekeeping and now I am with an
elderly couple&mdash;he has cancer&mdash;the same kind that Sam Rayburn had and he's
taken with leukemia.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's at the address you have just given us?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, you know Mrs. Johnson, don't you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; I knew her very muchly so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did you work for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, this last time I was there around 13 months&mdash;that was
the third time I had went back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When did you start working for her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I started working for her in 1949 the first time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you worked for her three times altogether?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; I got sick the first time&mdash;I'm a diabetic and wasn't able
to do the work and one day she called me again and wanted to know if I would
do it and I went back and stayed again and I went in a coma and had to leave,
and the reason why I left this time, she cut me down so low and the work was
too heavy&mdash;I wasn't able to do the work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean she cut you down on your money?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, yes; and I can't pay my doctor bill and buy my medicine
at that price.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean, she didn't pay you enough&mdash;that's the reason you quit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. That's the reason why I quit&mdash;the work was too heavy and I
wasn't able to do it and not enough pay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you were working there in October and November of last fall&mdash;1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; to my sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why to your sorrows?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, he was registered as O.&nbsp;H. Lee and I come to find out he
was Oswald and I wish I had never known it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, they put me through the third degree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Who did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. The FBI, Secret Service, Mr. Will Fritz' men and Bill Decker's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. They did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Every time I would walk out on the front porch somebody was
standing with a camera on me&mdash;they had me scared to death.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When is the first time you ever saw Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. The day he came in and rented the room&mdash;the 14th of October.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever heard of the man before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, and he didn't register as Oswald&mdash;he registered as O.&nbsp;H.
Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he sign his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. O.&nbsp;H. Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he sign his own name that way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. O.&nbsp;H. Lee&mdash;that's what he was registered as.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you rent it to him, or did Mrs. Johnson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I rented the room to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You did?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. She talked to him, and she had to go back to the work and
that was what I was supposed to do&mdash;I rented the rooms&mdash;she didn't know what
vacancies she had.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you have "room for rent" sign out in the front?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What time of day did he come in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, it was in the early afternoon&mdash;I imagine between 1 and 2
o'clock when he came in and looked at the room; and he rented it and paid for
it; and then left, and went and got his things and I don't know&mdash;it must have
been around 5 or 6 o'clock when he come back in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say he went and got his things&mdash;what did he have with him
at first when he came there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Just a little satchel bag and some clothes on a hanger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What kind of a satchel bag?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. One of them little zip kinds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. It was just&mdash;don't ask me that for I can't answer that. It was
just a dark bag is all I know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did he stay that first time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I mean before he went away to get his clothes, when he first
came in&mdash;you say he rented a room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He rented the room and paid me $8 for it and he said, "I'll
go get my things and I will be back."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say where he was going to get them?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, he didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he leave?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; he left.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have a car he was riding in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I don't know&mdash;I didn't see it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he take a bus?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, I don't. I don't remember&mdash;you know in a place like
that&mdash;when you rent a room&mdash;I didn't pay no attention.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And he came back about what time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, I imagine around 5 o'clock, maybe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he have with him at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. That little zipper satchel bag and some clothes on a hanger.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. The first time he came to see you he had a zipper satchel bag?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No; he didn't have nothing when he first come in and rented
the room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't have anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No&mdash;he just came in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Oh, when he came back he had the zipper satchel and the clothes
on the hanger, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No&mdash;he rented the room and paid for it and said, "I'll go get
my things." That's when he went and come back with his little satchel bag
and some clothes on a hanger, which was a very few.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did he have anything to say when he came back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he tell you where he had been?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he stay there that night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever talk to him about anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No; because he wouldn't talk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say "Hello"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or, "Goodby"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Or anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He wouldn't say nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever speak to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, yes&mdash;I would say, "Good afternoon," and he would just
maybe look at me&mdash;give me a dirty look and keep walking and go on to his
room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he watch television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No&mdash;in a way&mdash;but all he did ever watch the television was if
someone in the other rooms had it on, maybe he would come and stand at the
back of the couch&mdash;not over 5 minutes and go to his room and shut the door
and never say a word.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he go out any at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he stay home every night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes&mdash;he stayed home every night&mdash;I didn't ever know of him
going out. If he did, he left after I went to bed and I never knew it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was he gone any weekends?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He would leave on Friday nights&mdash;he did say this much&mdash;he
said, "Now, over weekends I will be out of town." He didn't say what town.
He said, "I will be going out of town visiting friends." He would leave Friday
morning for work and he wouldn't come back any more until Monday
afternoon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, was one weekend when he didn't come back on Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No; there was one weekend that he didn't go out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which one was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Now, as far as&mdash;you know what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that the weekend?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I think&mdash;now, if I had the books, I could tell you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Which books?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. The books that are over there on North Beckley. I believe
it was on the weekend before&mdash;when was President Kennedy shot?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 22d of November.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. What day was that&mdash;that was on Friday, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was on a Friday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, it was on the weekend before that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What happened&mdash;what was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He didn't go nowhere.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He stayed in all weekend, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes, sir; and then that first Thursday, he got up Thursday
and left for work and he didn't come back no more until Friday.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He left on Thursday and didn't come home on Thursday night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He didn't spend Thursday night there and that was unusual,
because he would always leave on Friday. That's the best I can do. He was
just the type of person you just don't know&mdash;and I just thought he didn't like
people and he would mix with nobody and he wouldn't say nothing. The only
time he would ever say anything was when his rent was due and he was never
behind.</p>

<p>I'll tell you when it was&mdash;it was when he didn't come back on Monday, you
know, there was a holiday that people took off work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was Armistice Day.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. That he said, "I have a long weekend."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He didn't come back on that Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, he didn't come back until the next day. He said he had a
long weekend.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was after his long weekend he came back on a Tuesday that
week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember the day the President was shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; I remember it&mdash;who would forget that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And the police officers came out there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember what they said?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, it was Will Fritz' men&mdash;it was plainclothesmen and
I was at the back doing something and Mr. Johnson answered the door and
they identified themselves and then he called me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did they say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, they asked him if there was a Harvey Lee Oswald there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What did he say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. And he says, "I don't know, I'll have to call the housekeeper,"
and he called me and I went and got the books and I said, "No; there's no one
here by that name," and they tried to make me remember and I couldn't, and
Mrs. Johnson come in in the meantime and there wasn't nobody there by that
name, and Mrs. Johnson said, "Mrs. Roberts, don't you have him?" And, I
said, "No; we don't, for here is my book and there is nobody there by that name."
We checked it back a year.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you didn't have that name&mdash;you didn't ever know his name
was Lee Oswald?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No&mdash;he registered as O.&nbsp;H. Lee and they were asking for
Harvey Lee Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say that you saw Lee Oswald&mdash;you say he didn't come home
Thursday night that week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He didn't come home on Thursday night that week.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And Friday was the day the President was shot? Had you seen
him at any time that Friday before the officers came up and knocked on your
door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Hadn't he been home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, let's see&mdash;that was the day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was on a <span class="locked">Friday&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Wait a minute, let me think of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's on a Friday.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I had better back up a minute&mdash;he came home that Friday in
an unusual hurry.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And about what time was this?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, it was after President Kennedy had been shot and I had
a friend that said, "Roberts, President Kennedy has been shot," and I said,
"Oh, no." She said, "Turn on your television," and I said "What are you trying
to do, pull my leg?" And she said, "Well, go turn it on." I went and turned
it on and I was trying to clear it up&mdash;I could hear them talking but I couldn't
get the picture and he come in and I just looked up and I said, "Oh, you are
in a hurry." He never said a thing, not nothing. He went on to his room and
stayed about 3 or 4 minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. As he came in, did you say anything else except, "You are in a
hurry"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say anything about the President being shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You were working with the television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I was trying to clear it up to see what was happening and
try to find out about President Kennedy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Why did you say to this man as he came in, "You are in a hurry,"&mdash;why
did you say that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, he just never has come in and he was walking unusually
fast and he just hadn't been that way and I just looked up and I said, "Oh,
you are in a hurry."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean he was walking faster than he usually was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he came in the door, what did he do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He just walked in&mdash;he didn't look around at me&mdash;he didn't say
nothing and went on to his room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he run?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He wasn't running, but he was walking pretty fast&mdash;he was all
but running.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He went to his room and he was in his shirt sleeves but I
couldn't tell you whether it was a long-sleeved shirt or what color it was or
nothing, and he got a jacket and put it on&mdash;it was kind of a zipper jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen him wear that jacket before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I can't say I did&mdash;if I did, I don't remember it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he came in he was in a shirt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He was in his shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What color was his shirt? Do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I don't remember. I didn't pay that much attention for I was
interested in the television trying to get it fixed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen that shirt before or seen him wear it&mdash;the shirt,
or do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I don't remember&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You say he put on a separate jacket?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. A jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. I'll show you this jacket which is Commission Exhibit 162&mdash;have
you ever seen this jacket before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, maybe I have, but I don't remember it. It seems like
the one he put on was darker than that. Now, I won't be sure, because I
really don't know, but is that a zipper jacket?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes&mdash;it has a zipper down the front.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, maybe it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was a zippered jacket, was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; it was a zipper jacket. How come me to remember it,
he was zipping it up as he went out the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He was zipping it up as he went out the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, when you saw him, did you see any part of his belt?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There is some suspicion that when he left there he might have had
a pistol or a revolver in his belt; did you see anything like that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No; I sure didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I show you Commission Exhibit No. 150&mdash;it is a shirt&mdash;have
you seen that before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, maybe I have. Now, that looks kind of like the dark
shirt that he had on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, when Oswald came in, he was in a shirt&mdash;does this shirt look
anything like the shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. It was a dark shirt he had on&mdash;I think it was a dark one, but
whether it was long sleeve or short sleeve or what&mdash;I don't know.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Does the color of this shirt which I show you here, Commission
Exhibit No. 150, look anything like the shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I'm sorry, I just don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You are not able to testify as to that&mdash;to tell us that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Can you tell me what time it was approximately that Oswald
came in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Now, it must have been around 1 o'clock, or maybe a little
after, because it was after President Kennedy had been shot&mdash;what time I
wouldn't want to say <span class="locked">because&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. How long did he stay in the room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, maybe not over 3 or 4 minutes&mdash;just long enough, I guess,
to go in there and get a jacket and put it on and he went out zipping it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You recall he went out zipping it&mdash;was he running or walking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He was walking fast&mdash;he was making tracks pretty fast.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything to you as he went out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you say anything to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Probably wouldn't have gotten no answer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. What is the only thing you said to him from the time he came in
the house until he left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. "You sure are in a hurry."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. That was all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That's all you said to him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. That's all I said to him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he say anything to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Nothing.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He didn't say nothing&mdash;he wouldn't say nothing&mdash;period.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have the same colored pants on when he left, or do you know?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. What?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did he have the same colored pants on when he came in as when
he went out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Now, I wouldn't say that because I don't remember&mdash;I didn't
pay that much attention. I didn't mean to be hateful, but I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, did it appear to you he had on the same pants or different
pants from the time he came in and when he went out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, I just didn't pay that much attention. All I remember&mdash;he
was zipping up a coat and I was trying to find out about President Kennedy&mdash;I
was still trying to find out about President Kennedy&mdash;they was broadcasting
it then&mdash;I was more interested in that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen a gun in his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever cleaned up his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; I cleaned his rooms, but I didn't see no gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever go through any of his effects?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was a little wooden commode or closet in there, wasn't
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. There was a chifforobe&mdash;yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever look in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, sir; I sure didn't&mdash;that's against the rules&mdash;to ransack
their things.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there any drawers or anything in there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; there was drawers in that chifforobe and he also had
a vanity dresser with four drawers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever look inside of that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No; I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. After he left the house and at sometime later in the afternoon,
these police officers came out, did they?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And they asked you if there was a man named Lee Oswald there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you told them "No"?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then what happened after that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, he was trying to make us understand that&mdash;I had two
new men and they told me&mdash;Mrs. Johnson told me, "Go get your keys and let
them see in" I had gone to the back and they still had the TV on, and they
was broadcasting about Kennedy.</p>

<p>Just as I unlocked the doors Fritz' men, two of them had walked in and she
come running in and said, "Oh, Roberts, come here quick. This is this fellow
Lee in this little room next to yours," and they flashed him on television, is
how come us to know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then you knew it was the man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; and I come in there and she said, "Wait," and then again
they flashed him back on and I said, "Yes, that's him&mdash;that's O.&nbsp;H. Lee right
here in this room." And it was just a little wall there between him and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. That was the first you knew who it was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes, because he was registered as O.&nbsp;H. Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever know he had a gun in his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No; I sure did not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever appear on a television interview with Mr. or Mrs.
Johnson&mdash;either one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, no; they was on and would be on and then they had me
on twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. On television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I was in the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And they brought their cameras into the living room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. They brought their cameras into the living room and took
pictures.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were you alone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, I was then, because they was questioning me. They
asked Mr. and Mrs. Johnson not to be in there at that time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Then, they questioned you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you ever have an interview with Mr. and Mrs. Johnson being
there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, yes; one time, and then they would question them separate
from me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was there any one time when they questioned all three of you
together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes&mdash;one time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Just one time&mdash;were you ever on television when you and Mrs.
Johnson were on it alone together?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. She and Mr. Johnson would be together and then I would be
at the back when they put them on television, and then they had me on two
different times and I was alone. They taken me when I was standing and
showed them where it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on television did they ever ask you if Oswald had a gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You don't remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did they ever ask you if you knew whether Oswald had a gun in
his room or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes; they asked me and I told them "No"&mdash;for I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You didn't know whether he had a gun in there or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No&mdash;I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never saw one?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you tell them that?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I sure did&mdash;I didn't know he had a gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And when he was zipping up his jacket, his belt was covered?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Was it covered&mdash;well&mdash;I don't know. I just couldn't answer
you&mdash;I don't know&mdash;I don't remember it. I couldn't any more tell you than
the man in the moon whether or not the man's belt was covered or uncovered.
All I know he was zipping his coat.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me ask you another question: Did you ever talk to a reporter
from a French newspaper?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. A French newspaper?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, there was people in there from about everywhere, but I
don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. There was some French newspaperman who claims he interviewed
you.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. French?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you remember any French newspapermen interviewing you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, I don't remember, but there were people in there from
somewhere but I don't remember where they were from.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever heard the name Lee Harvey Oswald before the
Friday when the police came out?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you had, of course, thought his name was what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. O.&nbsp;H. Lee.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He had paid you, had he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He always paid on time.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you made a record of it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, after these police officers came out of there, did you see a gun
holster in his room after they had searched it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes&mdash;there was one of them little outfits&mdash;a little holster and
they taken it out and where they got it&mdash;I don't know, but it was in the room.
They had it in their hands, one of the men was holding it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever seen that before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No; I hadn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Let me ask you something about his habits again&mdash;how early
would he leave his room in the morning?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, he would leave around 7 o'clock, maybe between 6:30 and
7.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And what time would he come back?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, he would get home about maybe 5&mdash;something around 5
o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And with the exception of the weekends that he spent away, was
he home every night or was he out at night?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He was always home at night&mdash;he never went out.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, on one holiday that occurred on Monday&mdash;he didn't come
in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, he didn't come in that Monday.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Was that the only Monday he didn't come in?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. That was the only Monday he didn't come in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He paid on Monday?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He paid on Monday and that was the only time he didn't pay
on Monday and he wasn't there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. He paid on what day of the week that week?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Tuesday&mdash;when he came in home.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. But the weekend before November 22d, he was there all weekend,
was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, I also will ask you whether or not you ever heard of a fellow
by the name of Ruby&mdash;did you ever hear of a fellow by the name of Jack Ruby?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No&mdash;I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had you ever heard his name before he was accused of shooting
Oswald?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never even heard his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You never even heard his name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No&mdash;I never heard his name.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And had never seen him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did a police car pass the house there and honked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When was that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. He came in the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. When he came in the house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. When he came in the house and went to his room, you know
how the sidewalk runs?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Right direct in front of that door&mdash;there was a police car
stopped and honked. I had worked for some policemen and sometimes they
come by and tell me something that maybe their wives would want me to know,
and I thought it was them, and I just glanced out and saw the number, and I
said, "Oh, that's not their car," for I knew their car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You mean, it was not the car of the policemen you knew?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. It wasn't the police car I knew, because their number was
170 and it wasn't 170 and I ignored it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And who was in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I don't know&mdash;I didn't pay any attention to it after I noticed
it wasn't them&mdash;I didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was it parked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. It was parked in front of the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. At 1026 North Beckley?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. And then they just eased on&mdash;the way it is&mdash;it was the third
house off of Zangs and they just went on around the corner that way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Went around what corner?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Went around the corner off of Beckley on Zangs.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Going which way&mdash;toward town or away from town?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Toward town.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goldberg</span>. Which way was the car facing?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. It was facing north.</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goldberg</span>. Towards Zangs?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Towards Zangs&mdash;for I was the third house right off of Zangs
on Beckley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did this police car stop directly in front of your house?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes&mdash;it stopped directly in front of my house and it just
"tip-tip" and that's the way Officer Alexander and Charles Burnely would do
when they stopped, and I went to the door and looked and saw it wasn't their
number.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Where was Oswald when this happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. In his room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was after he had come in his room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Had that police car ever stopped there before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I don't know&mdash;I don't remember ever seeing it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Have you ever seen it since?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No&mdash;I didn't pay that much attention&mdash;I just saw it wasn't
the police car that I knew and had worked for so, I forgot about it. I seen
it at the time, but I don't remember now what it was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you report the number of the car to anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I think I did&mdash;I'm not sure, because I&mdash;at that particular
time I remembered it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. You remembered the number of the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I think it was&mdash;106, it seems to me like it was 106, but I do
know what theirs was&mdash;it was 170 and it wasn't their car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. It was not 170?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. The people I worked for was 170.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Did you report that number to anyone, did you report this incident
to anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes, I told the FBI and the Secret Service both when they was
out there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And did you tell them the number of the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. I'm not sure&mdash;I believe I did&mdash;I'm not sure. I think I did
because&mdash;there was so much happened then until my brains was in a whirl.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. On the 29th of November, Special Agents Will Griffin and James
Kennedy of the Federal Bureau of Investigation interviewed you and you told
them that "after Oswald had entered his room about 1 p.m. on November 22,
1963, you looked out the front window and saw police car No. 207."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. No. 107.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Is that the number?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes&mdash;I remembered it. I don't know where I got that 106&mdash;207.
Anyway, I knew it wasn't 170.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And you say that there were two uniformed policemen in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes, and it was in a black car. It wasn't an accident squad
car at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Were there two uniformed policemen in the car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Oh, yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And one of the officers sounded the horn?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Just kind of a "tit-tit"&mdash;twice.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. And then drove on to Beckley toward Zangs Boulevard, is that
right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes. I thought there was a number, but I couldn't remember
it but I did know the number of their car&mdash;I could tell that. I want you to understand
that I have been put through the third degree and it's hard to remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Are there any other questions?</p>

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Goldberg</span>. No, that's all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Now, Mrs. Roberts, this deposition will be written up and you
can read it if you want to and you can sign it, or you can waive the signature.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, you know, I can't see too good how to read. I'm completely
blind in my right eye.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Do you want to waive your signature? And then you won't
have to come back down here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right, you waive it then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Do you want me to sign it now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. No; we couldn't, because this young lady has to write it up and
it will be a couple of weeks before it will be ready.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Well, will you want me to come back or how?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Well, you can waive your signature and you won't have to come
back to do that&mdash;do you want to do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. Okay, it will be all right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. All right. The Secret Service will take you home now.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Ball</span>. Thank you for coming.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Roberts</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember that he was assassinated in Dallas?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Oh, yes; I remember this.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That day you had lunch, were you at work that day?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You had lunch?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I had lunch. And then this man had stalled this car in the
middle of the street and asked me if I would fix it. Something was wrong
with the carburetor, or pump that had broken in it, and I went around to the
parts house to get the parts for it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where had the man's car stopped in the middle of the street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Well, on Patton Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Patton and what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Between Jefferson and 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A car stopped in the middle of the street <span class="locked">between&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Jefferson and Tenth.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time of day was this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I imagine it was about 1 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You imagine it was about 1 o'clock?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. It was after lunch. I had already eaten. It was after I
had lunch and I had eaten around 12, somewhere around 12 o'clock.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do? You were going to get a carburetor part, so
what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I was in a rush and I ran off and forgot the number of the
carburetor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You forgot the number of the carburetor?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Then I circled back. I left down the alley.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which alley is this?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. The one directly between 10th and Patton and Jefferson Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It runs parallel to 10th and Jefferson and it runs, the alley would
run east of Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. The alley runs right behind Dootch Motors there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What kind of vehicle were you driving?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. 1958 pickup truck Chevrolet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, what route did you take? Were you headed east or west
in the alley?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. East.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. To what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. To Denver street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which is the next street over from Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. First street east of Patton, then where?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I turned right, which is east on 10th. Wait. Denver would
be north, I imagine. I turned from the alley north on Denver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. And east on 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you turned east <span class="locked">on&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. The parts house sets on Marsalis and 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Marsalis and 10th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes; so I got almost up to the parts house and I thought
about the number, so I was going to go back and get the number off the carburetor.
I turned in a drive and turned around and started back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. On 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On East 10th?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I was going west on 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Then I got almost up to the corner when I seen the policeman.
I first seen the car stop up there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, you say you got almost to a corner. What corner was
that?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. At Denver and 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You almost got up to Denver and 10th heading west on 10th
Street when you saw something?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I saw this police car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw a police car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was the police car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. It was sitting about 4 or 5 feet from the curb and down about
2 houses from the corner of Patton Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Was it between Patton and Denver?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. On what side of East 10th, north or south?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. On the south side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What direction was it headed?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. It was headed east.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I then pulled on up and I seen this officer standing by the
door. The door was open to the car, and I was pretty close to him, and I
seen Oswald, or the man that shot him, standing on the other side of the
car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Did you see the officer as he was getting out of the
car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; I seen as he was, well, he had his hand on the door
and kind of in a hurry to get out, it seemed like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had he already gotten out of the car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. He had already gotten around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did you see the other man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. The other man was standing to the right side of the car,
riders side of the car, and was standing right in front of the windshield on
the right front fender. And then I heard the shot. Actually I wasn't looking for
anything like that, so I heard the shot, and I just turned into the curb. Looked
around to miss a car, I think.</p>

<p>And then I pulled up to the curb, hitting the curb, and I ducked down, and
then I heard two more shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear all told?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I heard three shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You heard three shots?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when your vehicle stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. About 15 foot, just directly across the street and maybe a car
length away from the police car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you have been a car length to the east or a car length to
the west of the police car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. East of the front side of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So your vehicle wouldn't have quite gotten up to where the police
car was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; it didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How fast were you going when you watched the policeman getting
out of his car?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Oh, I imagine not maybe 25 miles an hour. I never did pay
much attention to it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say you stopped the car right away? Your vehicle, I mean?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir. I just didn't exactly stop because&mdash;I just pulled it
into the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you say you heard a shot and you then ducked?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes. No; I heard the shot before I pulled in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Oh, I see. You heard the shot and pulled in and then what?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Then I ducked down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Then I heard the other two shots and I looked up and the
policeman was in, he seemed like he kind of stumbled and fell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see the policeman as he fell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What else did you see?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Then I seen the man turn and walk back to the sidewalk and
go on the sidewalk and he walked maybe 5 foot and then kind of stalled. He
didn't exactly stop. And he threw one shell and must have took five or six more
steps and threw the other shell up, and then he kind of stepped up to a pretty
good trot going around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw the man going around the corner headed in what direction
on what street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. On Patton Street. He was going south.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was going south on Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes; do you know Dootch Motors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do I know Dootch Motors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he on the east or the west side of Patton as he was going?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. On the east side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw him going on the east?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you see him go down Patton?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Just as far as the house would let the view go. In other words,
as soon as he went past the house, I couldn't see him any more.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, the first time that you saw him, what was his position?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. He was standing, the first time I saw him. The man that
shot him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. He was standing like I say, on the center in front of the
windshield, right directly on the right front fender of the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was not moving when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; he wasn't moving then.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, after you saw him turn around the corner, what did you
do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. After that, I set there for just a few minutes to kind of, I
thought he went in back of the house or something. At the time, I thought
maybe he might have lived in there and I didn't want to get out and rush right
up. He might start shooting again.</p>

<p>That is when I got out of the truck and walked over to the policeman, and
he was lying there and he had, looked like a big clot of blood coming out of his
head, and his eyes were sunk back in his head, and just kind of made me feel
real funny. I guess I was really scared.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the policeman say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. The policeman, I believe was dead when he hit the ground,
because he didn't put his hand out or nothing.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was the policeman as he fell, as you saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I saw him as he was falling. The door was about half way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
open, and he was right in front of the door, and just about in front of the fender.
I would say he was between the door and the front headlight, about middleway
when he started to fall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you notice where the gun of the policeman was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. The gun was in his hand and he was partially lying on his
gun in his right hand. He was partially lying on his gun and on his hand, too.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Then I don't know if I opened the car door back further than
what it was or not, but anyway, I went in and pulled the radio and I mashed
the button and told them that an officer had been shot, and I didn't get an
answer, so I said it again, and this guy asked me whereabouts all of a sudden,
and I said, on 10th Street. I couldn't remember where it was at at the time.</p>

<p>So I looked up and I seen this number and I said 410 East 10th Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw a number on the house then?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Then he started to&mdash;then I don't know what he said; but I
put the radio back. I mean, the microphone back up, and this other guy was
standing there, so I got up out of the car, and I don't know, I wasn't sure if he
heard me, and the other guy sat down in the car.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There was another passerby that stopped?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was he, do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I couldn't tell you. I don't know who he was.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he driving a car or walking?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I don't know. He was just standing there whenever I looked
up. He was standing at the door of the car, and I don't know what he said to
the officer or the phone, but the officer told him to keep the line clear, or something,
and stay off the phone, or something like that. That he already knew
about it.</p>

<p>So then I turned and walked off. I never did assist him after that at all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. At the time I walked out, I guess I was scared, so I started
across the street&mdash;alley between the two houses to my mother's house, and I
got in the yard and I said I'd better go back, or just caught myself until I got
over there, I guess, so I went back around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you went back, what did you do?</p>

<p>First of all, was there anything up to that time that you saw there or that
you did that you haven't related here that you can think of right now?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Well. I started&mdash;I seen him throw the shells and I started to
stop and pick them up, and I thought I'd better not so when I came back, after
I had gotten back, I picked up the shells.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, you said you saw the man with the gun throw
the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, did you see the man empty his gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. That is what he was doing. He took one out and threw it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember in which hand he was holding his gun?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; I sure don't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember if he was trying to put anything in the gun
also?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes. As he turned the corner he was putting another shell
in his gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I mean, he was acting like. I didn't see him actually put a
shell in his gun, but he acted like he was trying to reload it.</p>

<p>Maybe he was trying to take out another shell, but he could have been
reloading it or something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you now, I would like to have you relate again the
action of the man with the gun as you saw him now.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. As I saw him, I really&mdash;I mean really got a good view of the
man after the bullets were fired, he had just turned. He was just turning away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
In other words, he was pointing toward the officer, and he had just turned
away to his left, and then he started. There was a big tree, and it seemed like
he started back going to the curb of the street and into the sidewalk, and then
he turned and went down the sidewalk to, well, until he got in front of the corner
house, and then he turned to the left there and went on down Patton Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he got in front of the corner, when you say he turned to
his left, did he cut across the yard of the house, or did he go clear to the corner
and turn off?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. There is a big bush and he catty-cornered across the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He kitty-cornered across the yard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes. In other words, he didn't go all the way on the sidewalk.
He just cut across the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he when you saw him throwing shells? Had he
already started across the yard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No, sir. He had just got back to the sidewalk when he
threw the first one and when he threw the second one, he had already cut
back into the yard. He just sort of cut across.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you saw him throw two shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw where he threw the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you later go back in that area and try and find the shells?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes. Well, right after that I went back and I knew exactly
where they was at, and I went over and picked up one in my hand, not thinking
and I dropped it, that maybe they want fingerprints off it, so I took out an
empty pack of cigarettes I had and picked them up with a little stick and put
them in this cigarette package; a chrome looking shell.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A chrome looking shell?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how long did it take you to locate the shells once you
started looking for them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Just a minute. I mean not very long at all. Just walked
directly to them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw where he had thrown them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. One of them went down inside of a bush, and the other one
was by the bush.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him after he turned the corner of the house?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know whether or not he threw any&mdash;you said you heard
three shots. Do you know whether or not he threw other shells there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you look at all there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; I didn't bother to look there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him when he cut across the yard? Did he go between
the bushes to get to the sidewalk on Patton Street, or do you know?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Between the house and the bush; yes, sir. He had to cut
across the yard, because there was a big bush on the corner there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of about the man after you saw him?
What was he wearing? What did he look like?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Well, he was kind of, well, just about your size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About my size? I am standing up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. You are about 5' 10"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am between 5' 10" and 5' 11". Closer to 5' 11", I believe.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I would say he was about your size, and he had a light-beige
jacket, and was lightweight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did it have buttons or a zipper, or do you remember?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. It seemed like it was a zipper-type jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color was the trousers?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. They were dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what kind of shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. It was dark in color, but I don't remember exactly what
color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he average weight, slender, or heavy?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I would say he was average weight.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color hair did he have?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Oh, dark. I mean not dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Black hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No. Not black or brown, just kind of <span class="locked">a&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. My color hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say he is my size, my weight, and my color hair?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. He kind of looks like&mdash;well, his hair was a little bit curlier.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else about him that looked like me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No, that is all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about his skin? Was he fair complexioned or dark complexioned?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. He wasn't dark.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Average complexion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; a little bit darker than average.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. My complexion?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I wouldn't say that any more. I would say he is about your
complexion, sir. Of course he looked, his skin looked a little bit ruddier than
mine.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. His skin looked ruddier than mine?</p>

<p>I might say for the record, that I was not in Dallas on November 22, 1963.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No, just your size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he look like me?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; your face, not your face, but just your size.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Okay, well, I thank you. I was flying from St. Louis to Des
Moines, Iowa, at about this time.</p>

<p>Is there anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I remember the back of his head seemed like his hairline was
sort of&mdash;looked like his hairline sort of went square instead of tapered off,
and he looked like he needed a haircut for about 2 weeks, but his hair didn't
taper off, it kind of went down and squared off and made his head look flat
in back.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you put these two shells that you found in this cigarette
package, what did you do with them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I gave them to an officer.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That came out to the scene shortly after?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember the name of the officer?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No, sir; I didn't even ask him. I just told him that this
was the shells that he had fired, and I handed them to him. Seemed like he was
a young guy, maybe 24.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How old would you say the man that you saw with gun was?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I figured he was around 25.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When the officers came out there, did you tell them what you had
seen?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I left right after. I give the shells to the officer. I turned
around and went back and we returned to work.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what happened? Did the officers ever get in touch with
you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Later on that evening, about 4 o'clock, there was two officers
came by and asked for me, Mr. Callaway asked me&mdash;I had told them that I had
seen the officer, and the reporters were there and I was trying to hide from the
reporters because they will just bother you all the time.</p>

<p>Then I found out that they thought this was the guy that killed the President.
At the time I didn't know the President was dead or he had been shot. So
I was just trying to hide from the reporters and everything, and these two officers
came around and asked me if I'd seen him, and I told him yes, and told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
them what I had seen, and they asked me if I could identify him, and I said
I don't think I could.</p>

<p>At this time I was sure, I wasn't sure that I could or not. I wasn't going
to say I could identify and go down and couldn't have.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he ever take you to the police station and ask you if you
could identify him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; they didn't.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You used the name Oswald. How did you know this man was
Oswald?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. From the pictures I had seen. It looked like a guy, resembled
the guy. That was the reason I figured it was Oswald.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were they newspaper pictures or television pictures, or both, or
neither?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Well, television pictures and newspaper pictures. The thing
lasted about a month, I believe, it seemed like.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I showed&mdash;I believe they showed pictures of him every day
for a long time there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you talk to anyone at all there that witnessed what was
going on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; sure didn't. There was people that asked me what
happened, came up in the crowd there and asked me what happened, and I
said just the policeman got shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You talked to Ted Callaway, did you?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; afterward. You know, I told your&mdash;I told him, he asked
me when we went, when Ted Callaway got around there, he opened the car door
and picked up the phone and called in and told them there was an officer that
had been killed. But the officer on the other side of the radio told him to hang
up the phone to keep the lines clear, or something of that sort.</p>

<p>Then he jumped out and ran around and he asked me did I see what happened,
and I said yes. And he said let's chase him, and I said no.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Why did you say "No"?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Well, he was reaching down and getting the gun out of the
policeman's hand, and I didn't think he should bother to go like that. So he
then turned around and went to the cab that was sitting on the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This cab?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes. There was a cab sitting&mdash;oh, there isn't a sidewalk on
Patton Street. I mean there is sidewalks, but not a curb, and this cab had
pulled in there by the stop sign.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Which way was the cab headed on Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. It was headed north on Patton Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it on the south side of 10th or the north side of 10th when
it was parked there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. It would be on the south side of 10th.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it on the east side of Patton or the west?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. It would be on the east side of Patton.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How close to the sidewalk on East 10th would the front part
of the cab have been?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. The front part of the cab was, I would say, maybe 5 or 6
feet from the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. From the corner?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. He was sort of, if it had been a curb there, he would be up
on the curb.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. And so Ted then got in the taxicab and the taxicab came
to a halt and he asked me which way he went. I told him he went down
Patton Street toward the office, and come to find out later Ted had already
seen him go by there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Ted tell you later he had seen him go by?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes; then we had a colored porter that said he had seen
him go by.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this be Sam Guinyard?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Ted say whether or not he had gone down to the police station
to try to identify the man?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. After that&mdash;After I left that evening, I took off kind of
early because I was so shookup that I couldn't work, and so when I say early,
I usually work to 9 or 10 or 11 o'clock, at night. So I'd taken off early and
the next day the kid told me that he went down there. I think it was the next
day, or the day after.</p>

<p>Well, it was the next day he told me that they went down and identified him as
the guy that came by the carlot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Ted told you the next day at work that he had gone down and
identified him?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes; I don't know if Ted told me, but somebody told me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Ted worked at Dootch Motors at the same time?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What does he do there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. General manager.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Used-car place?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am going to go down and get some clothing and see if you can
identify it and I will be back in 1 minute.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Okay.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am handing you a jacket which has been marked as "Commission's
Exhibit 163," and ask you to state whether this bears any similarity to the
jacket you saw this man with the gun wearing?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I would say this looks just like it. Looks like he had
laundried it, but it looks like it was a newer coat than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I am handing you what has been marked "Commission's Exhibit
150," and see if this looks anything like the shirt that he had on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I think the shirt looked darker than that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The shirt was darker?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I couldn't tell at the time because he had the jacket on there.
That was a waist-type jacket, wasn't it?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Yes; anything else you can think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Not offhand, except later on, I don't know if I seen it on television
but I believe I seen it on television where they was arresting him, the
policeman from the theater. But it didn't seem like he had a jacket on there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When he was being arrested you say he didn't have a jacket on?
Now at the time you saw him, did he have a jacket on?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. He had a jacket on and it looked like that jacket there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; I guess that is all I can think of right now.</p>

<p>I think there was another car that was in front of me, a red Ford, I believe.
I didn't know the man, but I guess he was about 25 or 30, and he pulled over.
I didn't never see him get out of his car, but when he heard the scare, I guess
he was about six cars from them, and he pulled over, and I don't know if he
came back there or not.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. That would be all. I think if anybody had seen anything
really closeup, that he must have fired just as they got past him, and they must
have seen him standing there, because he was right directly in front of me.
And whenever you see a squad car parked like that, you think something is
wrong. At least that is what comes to my mind.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. That is all I can think of right now that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. That is all I can think of right now that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You and I never met before today, did we, except that one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
when we were around to see Ted Callaway and he introduced you at Dootch
Motors and we chatted for 3 or 4 minutes there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes; you and two other men.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Today when we met, you came up here and what is the facts
as to whether I asked you before the court reporter was able to get here to just
relate to me what happened, or did I start questioning you or try to tell you
things as I saw them?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. So; you just asked me what happened and I described to you
what happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything you said before the court reporter got here that
is different in anyway that you said after the court reporter started taking
your testimony?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Maybe now only in the change of time, or I imagine I added
a little bit since she was here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything that would be at variance with what you told
me before the court reporter got here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Well, I don't understand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What I mean is, is there anything that you said before the court
reporter got here that you haven't included after the court reporter got here?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything you have said in front of the court reporter that has
been different insofar as being a fact which is opposite or different in anyway
from what you told me before?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Different in wording <span class="locked">but&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But are the facts different?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. No; I don't believe the facts are different.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you have a right, if you want to, to come back and read the
deposition and sign it, or you can just rely on the court reporter's accuracy and
waive the signing of it. Do you want to waive it or not?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. I would like to read it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Maybe I could add something I didn't add.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, I will ask the court reporter to try and get in touch
with you.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. 3112 June Drive.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. She can reach you at Dootch Motors?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Dootch Motors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is the address?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. 501 East Jefferson.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You did get notice of the taking of this deposition here today?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are here voluntarily appearing in front of the Commission?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, we surely appreciate all of the cooperation you have
shown here, sir, and if there is anything else that you think is important, we
would appreciate your getting in touch with us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. That is the reason I wanted to read this, in case I might
have left out something.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you please thank whoever is the general manager at Dootch
Motors for letting you come here and appear before us?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Benavides</span>. That is Mr. Harris.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was a frame apartment house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. A frame apartment house. You and your husband lived in one
apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. And my sister and her husband lived in another one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. There were two apartments there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. On the bottom floor.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What is your sister's name?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Mrs. Barbara Jeanette Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what her husband's name is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Troy Lee Davis.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Taking you back to the afternoon of November 22, do you remember
anything out of the ordinary that happened on that date?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, the boy that was known as Lee Harvey Oswald shot J.&nbsp;D.
Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, now, did you see him shoot J.&nbsp;D. Tippit?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No; we didn't see. Yes; we heard the shot. He had already shot
him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say you heard a shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where were you when you heard the shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I was over at my sister-in-law's.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Her apartment?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where in her apartment were you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I was in the living room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were in the living room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes. We was lying down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were lying down in the living room on the sofa bed, or what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It is a bed against the wall and a sofa.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who was lying down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, Jeanette was lying on the bed. I was lying on the couch,
and Annette and James Lee were lying on the other bed.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are these other people children of your sister's?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how old are those children?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. James will be 6 and then Annette is 5.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now as you were lying down, what did you see or hear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We just heard a shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How many shots did you hear?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We heard the first one and then we thought maybe someone had
a blowout like a tire or something and we didn't get up to see. Then we heard
the second shot and that is when we ran to the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, now, does that mean that you heard two shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Are you sure there were not more than two, or are you sure that
you heard two?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We just heard two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, Mrs. Markham was trying to <span class="locked">say&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you know what her first name is?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir. I just know her by Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you ever known her before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you know it was Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, it said in the paper that it was Mrs. Markham, and my
sister-in-law said it was Mrs. Markham. My sister-in-law knows Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you heard the shots. You heard, you say, the second shot
and then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We was already up. We ran to the door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By we, who do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Jeanette and I.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You went to which door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The front door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be the front of the house facing East 10th Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Mrs. Markham was standing at the tree.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. If we can picture the street intersection, was she standing in the
middle of the street or on the sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She was on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Let me ask you this. Your house would be located at the southeast
corner of the intersection, is that where it is, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would she be standing on a corner that would be right across
10th Street but on the same side of Patton, or across Would it be catty-cornered
or would it be across 10th Street but on the other side? Maybe we can draw
it here on a little paper.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't remember it too good.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I have drawn on a piece of paper here a street intersection
and this is Patton and here is 400 East 10th, which would be your house. Do
you want to mark here where you think you saw Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, she was standing on the sidewalk right here. Do you
want to put an "X" there?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Please put an "X" there.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. (Marks "X".)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I'm going to call that Virginia Davis Deposition, Exhibit 1.
What was Mrs. Markham saying, or did you hear her say anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We heard her say "He shot him. He is dead. Call the police."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was she saying this in a soft or loud voice?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She was screaming it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anything else as you heard her screaming?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, we saw Oswald. We didn't know it was Oswald at the
time. We saw that boy cut across the lawn emptying the shells out of the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, you saw a boy. Do you know how old he was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He didn't look like he was over 20.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what color hair he had?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Let's see, the best I recall, he had sort of light brown.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Light brown hair?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he tall or short or average height?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was about average height.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Fat, thin, or average weight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Slim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Slim.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He had on a light-brown-tan jacket.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what color his trousers were?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I think they were black. Brown jacket and trousers.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The trousers were black?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what kind of shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; I don't recall that.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the jacket open or closed up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was open.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But you don't remember what kind of shirt he had on?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he look at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; not that I remember. I don't think so.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And where was he when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was cutting across our yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In what direction was he walking?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was <span class="locked">walking&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Away from Patton or towards Patton?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Towards Patton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you first saw him, had he gotten up to your yard yet or
not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; he was cutting over across our yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was cutting across your walk that leads up to the front door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far from the main sidewalk on East 10th was he?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was about 3 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About 3 feet or so?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; when I first saw him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then he was cutting across your sidewalk about 3 feet away
from the main sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then did you see him&mdash;how long did you see him? Where did
you see him go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw him go around the corner of our house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How far did you see him go?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, when he disappeared around that corner, that is the last
we saw of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him go through any bushes by your house or not?
Or didn't you see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean you didn't see him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw him when he cut across our yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he when you last saw him? He was&mdash;was he still in
your yard, or was he on the sidewalk on Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was still in our yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We already called the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You called the police before you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. When Mrs. Markham was standing across the street hollering,
she told us to call the police, so Jeanette and I went in there, and Jeanette called
the police and we went back and he was cutting across our yard, and we gave
him time to go on because we were afraid he might shoot us.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you call the police before or after you saw him cut across
your yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, to your&mdash;to the best of your recollection, you
heard the shots, you ran outside, you saw Mrs. Markham&mdash;did you see anything
else when you saw Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; we just saw a police car sitting on the side of the road.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was the police car parked?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was parked between the hedge that marks the apartment
house where he lives in and the house next door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it on your side of East 10th or the other side of the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was on our side, the same side that we lived on.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it headed as you looked to the police car, towards your
right or towards your left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any police officer in a police car when you first saw
him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When your sister went to call the police, did you go with her,
or did you stay by the front door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I went with her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you hear your sister do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, she called the police and told whoever answered the phone
that there had been a murder out in front of our house, to come quick.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did she do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She hung up and then we went back to the front door and told
the two kids to stay indoors.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Then we went out in the front yard and right down to the police
car and that is when we saw the policeman lying on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was the policeman lying?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was lying just, well, he was half between the front end of
his car and, well, his head was lying toward the front end of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he on the driver's side of the front or on the other side?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was on the driver's side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, now, as I understand your testimony, after you made
the call, you went out to the front yard, is that it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You then went out to see the policeman in the street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you went out in the front yard, were you in the front
yard when the man was going by there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; he had already gone when we went outside.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He had already gone when you went outside?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I thought you said that when you went outside you went on the
sidewalk?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. See, all the people had already&mdash;see, he was already gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had he gone by at that time?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. By the time we got back from off the phone, he had already
gone. He had already disappeared behind the corner of our house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him going in front of your house before you called
on the phone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes. When we heard the second shot, we ran to the front
door, and that is when we saw the boy cutting across the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let me see if I understand your statement now. You went
to the front door after you heard the second shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the front door? Did you open
the front door, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; we just looked through the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You looked through the front door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was there a screen door on it or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was a screen door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you looking through the screen door, or was the screen
door partially open, if you remember.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was closed. We was looking through it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were looking through the screen door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were you in front of your sister-in-law, or was she in front
of you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She was in front of me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You were both looking through the screen door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see when you looked through the screen door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw a boy walking, cutting across our yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was he when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was about 3 feet from the sidewalk. Not the one that comes
up to our front door, but the other sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was about 3 feet from the front sidewalk on East 10th?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had he come up to your sidewalk yet that comes up from East
10th to your front door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, he had already. He was about half on the concrete, I think.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was half on that concrete?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you watch this man do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We watched him unload the shells out of his gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What hand was he holding this gun in?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. In the right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was holding the gun in his right hand, if you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What was he doing with his left hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was emptying the shells in his left hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was the gun broken open, so to speak? In other words. I don't
know if you have ever seen a capgun. When you want to load the capgun,
you have to kind of break it apart on a hinge.</p>

<p>Was the gun broken apart like that, or was the barrel straight?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was like the real gun, little one.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What do you mean it was just like?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was just as best as I can remember, it was a little pistol,
and he was emptying the shells. Where the shell was coming out, he was
emptying the shells into his left hand.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see what he did with the shells when he emptied them
into his left hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. After we, well, he was dropping them on the ground because
we found two.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You said that you found two? Did you see him drop them on
the ground or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No; we didn't see him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You just saw him emptying shells in his hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You didn't actually see what he did with them when he got
them in his hand, did you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are nodding your head no?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you see the man do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, he just cut across. He disappeared from behind the corner
of the house.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Going toward what street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, going toward Jefferson Street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. He was headed on Patton in the direction toward Jefferson?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see him actually get to Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; he was already around the corner.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw him go around the corner of your home?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do or see then?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, we just went out, because we had already called the police,
notified them, and we went out in the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You notified the police. Let me ask you this. Did you notify
the police before or after you saw the boy with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Let's see, I think it was before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you say before, what do you mean?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, before we saw the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before you saw the boy you notified the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, let me try and reconstruct your actions then.
You heard the shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You ran to the door?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see when you got to the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, we just saw, you know, the police car parked down there
and we wondered what was going on, so we heard Mrs. Markham across the
street calling.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, she told us to call the police, well, so went to the house.
We was already in the house, and we went to the phone and called the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Then we went back to the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw the boy cutting across the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do or see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. After he disappeared around the corner we ran out in the front
yard and down to see what had happened.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then is that when you saw the policeman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I saw the policeman lying on the street.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Did you see or do anything else? Did you see anyone
else that you know come up to the policeman?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No sir; there was a lot of people around there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember about what time of day this was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I wouldn't say for sure. But it was about 1:30, between 1:30
and 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, after this, did police come out there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; they was already there.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. By the time you got out there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, we just stood out there and watched. You know, tried to
see how it all happened. But we saw part of it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We stood out there until after the ambulance had come and
picked him up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. And we stood out there and talked to this woman who told us
that President Kennedy was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. This woman had told us that President Kennedy was shot.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. When the police cars was circling all the blocks, about four or
five blocks to see if they could find the boy, and we stayed out there all that
time to see if they would locate him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, did you tell the police, that you had seen anyone with a
gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; we told them that we saw a boy carrying a gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, that <span class="locked">was&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you ever go down to the police station or identify him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; we had to identify him in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What day was that? This same day or another day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Same day.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About what time of the day was it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was probably about 5:30.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Who went down with you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, let's see, my sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That would be Barbara Jeanette Davis?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; and her husband Troy Lee and myself.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the police station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We stayed there until this detective, some man walked up to us
and led us to this dark room.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before they led you to the dark room, did he show you any pictures
of anyone?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you seen any pictures on television of anyone that might be
the man you saw walking with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you watched television at all?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No; we didn't watch television.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had you seen any newspapers that afternoon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; we didn't get the newspapers until that following morning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you went with the detective to a dark room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the dark room?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He told us to sit down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. And then these five boys, or men walked up on this platform, and
he was No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say he was No. 2. Who was No. 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The boy that shot Tippit.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean the man&mdash;did you see him shoot Tippit? Or you mean
the man you saw with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The man I saw carrying the gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was he white or a Negro man?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was white.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Were all the men in the lineup white men or some Negroes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. All of them were white.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Could you describe any other people in the lineup as to whether
they might be fat or thin or short or tall?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, one of them was sort, well, he was tall and slim. And
then the other one there, he was sort of chubby and he was short. Then this
other one, he was about the same height as the other one, the last one I told
you about, short and chubby. And the other one was about&mdash;medium tall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now you identified someone in that lineup?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear your sister-in-law identify him first, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; I identified him first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was your sister when you identified him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She was sitting right next to me.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. How did you identify him? Did you yell that this is the man I
saw?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No; I just leaned over and told the detective it was No. 2.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was the detective? Was he to your right or to your left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Let's see, to my right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where was your sister, to your right or to your left?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. As she was to your right, so you leaned over to the detective and
told the detective it was No. 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else that you can think of that happened that day?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Later did you ever see a picture of Lee Harvey Oswald on
television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you first see it on television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. When they was bringing him out of the jail out here.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. When they were bringing him out of the jail.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean Sunday when he got shot?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did this look, could you tell whether this was the same man you
saw running with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I wouldn't say for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You mean from seeing his picture on television?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the man you identified as No. 2? Would you say
for sure that he was the man you saw running with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I would say that was him for sure.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What you are saying is that you couldn't necessarily tell from
the television picture?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir. Our television was blurred anyway, so we couldn't
hardly tell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember that you signed a statement when you were
down at the Dallas Police Department at all, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I'm going to hand you what has been marked as Virginia Davis
Deposition, Exhibit 2, and ask you to state if this is your signature on here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, Sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would you read the contents of your deposition Exhibit 2, and I
will ask you if there is anything there that is inaccurate.</p>

<p>(Reads statement.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have read Exhibit 2?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything in that statement that is inaccurate in any
way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is that what you told the police of Dallas on November 22, 1963?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now on this statement it says that you heard a shot and then
another shot and ran to the side door at Patton Street. Was that the side door
or front door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then it says, "I saw the boy cutting across our yard and he was
unloading his gun." Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then it says, "We walked outside and a woman was hollering,
'He's dead, he's dead, he's shot.'" Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then it says, "This woman told Jeanette to call the police and
she did." Is that what happened?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It says, "I saw the officer that had been shot lying on 10th Street
after Jeanette had called the police." Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now it says, "Jeanette found a empty shell that the man had
unloaded and gave it to the police." Did you see Jeanette find that shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes. I was right along behind her.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Where did she find it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She found it beside, well, the apartment was facing this way.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Facing Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir. And we was already outside. We thought maybe we
could find some evidence for the police. So we went through the hedge, and
by my front door of the apartment where we live, right there in the grass
where he dropped them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Had the police started to search around your house yet when
they found it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; they already started to search.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Would this have been to the side of the house or the corner of
the house that you found, that Jeanette found that shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was by the side.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This would have been by the side of the house that is next to
Patton Street?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About how far from the front of the house would it be?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was about 5 feet.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About 5 feet. You saw Jeanette find the shell? You saw her
pick it up from the ground?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What color was it, do you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The best I can recall, it was gray, one of <span class="locked">these&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The best you can recall, it was gray?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did Jeanette do with it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She gave it to some detective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see her find any other shells?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I found one after Jeanette, after all the police had gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When did you find yours?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was about 10 minutes after all the police had gone.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that before or after you went down to the police station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. About when before?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, I would say it was about 2:30, or 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Mrs. Davis, when did you say you found this other shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was about 4.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see or know of anyone else finding any other shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what you did with your shell when you found it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, before I picked it up, this boy told me that was walking
along with us helping us find, see if we could find anything for evidence, he
told me the police would get me if I picked it up by my fingers, and take fingerprints,
and I got scared and ran to the house and got a Kleenex tissue and
brought back outside and wrapped the shell in.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do with it when you wrapped the shell up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Jeanette took it and put it in her apartment up on the mantle-board.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Then about 5:30 the same day the police called and wanted us
to come down and identify him in the lineup.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do with the shell?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I gave it to the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you give it to him at your house or down at the police station?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. They come and picked us up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You gave it to the officer that came to pick you up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember what his name was, or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now in your statement, Virginia Davis Deposition Exhibit 2,
now you state that, "Jeanette found an empty shell that the man had unloaded
and gave it to the police. After the police had left I found a empty shell in
our yard." Is this the same shell you gave to Detective Dhority? Does the
name Detective Dhority sound familiar to you now, or don't you remember?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I never did hear the detective called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I didn't hear the detective's name called.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say, "The man that was unloading the gun was the same
man that I saw tonight as No. 2 man in a lineup." Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mrs. Davis, on this statement, Virginia Davis Deposition
Exhibit 2, it states that "We heard a shot and then another shot and ran to
side door at Patton Street." You say that should have been the front door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That was supposed to be the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say, "I saw the boy cutting across our yard and he was
unloading his gun. We walked outside and a woman was hollering, 'he's dead,
he's, he's shot'." "This woman told Jeanette to call the police and she did."
Now according to this statement, you saw the man cutting across your yard
before you called the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now this statement is wrong, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It is your testimony now, as I understand it, that you went back
in the house and you called the police, and then you went back outside the house
and saw the boy cutting across the yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. That is your statement now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now I hand you what is Deposition Exhibit 3, and ask you to
state if your signature appears on Deposition Exhibit 3?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This appears to be an affidavit dated December 1, 1963, and I
would like you to read the statement if you would.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. (Reads statement.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You have now had an opportunity to read over Virginia Davis
Deposition Exhibit 3, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything on that statement that is not accurate?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. As I recall, this is all right on that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I recall that is all right on that statement.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything on that statement that is not accurate, to the
best of your knowledge?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are nodding your head no?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Not that I recall.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, in this statement it says that you and your sister-in-law
were lying on the bed with the two children when you heard a loud bang, and
immediately following the first report there was another loud bang and you
jumped up and ran to the front door? Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then it says, "When we got to the door and went out on the porch,
I saw a man who I later that day identified at the Dallas Police Department."
Is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, according to this statement, you saw the man when you first
got to the door and went out on the porch? Now, did you see him then, or
did you see <span class="locked">him&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw him cut across after he had shot the policeman. We saw
him cut across our yard, and that is the last we saw of him.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Well, now, you actually didn't see him shoot the policeman, did
you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw&mdash;&mdash;just saw the man with the gun?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I just saw the man with the gun cutting across the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you heard some shots?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. After I heard the two shots.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, about how soon after you heard the two shots did you get
to the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, we didn't even put on our shoes. We just run to the front
door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was it a matter of seconds or a matter of minutes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. A matter of seconds.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got there, you opened the door, and what did you see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw this boy or man cut across the yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, and he had a revolver in his hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That is right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In his right hand or left hand?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. In his right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. This statement goes on to say that "The man had a revolver in
his left hand and was shaking the shells out of it into his right hand." Is that
right or wrong?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Wrong.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was the other way around?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was the other way around.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got to the door and you opened the door, and what did you
see now?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw this boy cut across our yard unloading the shells out of his
gun.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Mrs. Markham, this woman, was standing across the street
hollering to us to call the police. So we went back in there and called the police.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right. Now, this statement says, goes on to say, "This man
was coming across the yard and was almost to the walk which leads directly
to the porch and is in a direct line with the front door."</p>

<p>Is that where the man was when you first saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "The man had a revolver in his left hand and was shaking the
shells out of it into his right hand."</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was the other way, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. But you say "The man had a revolver in his left hand and was
shaking the shells out of it into his right hand. As the man passed directly
in front of us, he looked up for a second or so and then continued on across
the yard to Patton Street in a normal walk." Was he walking or running
when you saw him?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. He was walking.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did he look up at you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Pardon?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, you just remember kind of seeing him from a side view?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "At about this time, a woman directly across the intersection
from our house yelled out, 'He's dead, he's dead, he shot him.'"</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "The man glanced up at the woman and kept on walking." Did
you see the man glance up at Mrs. Markham when she was yelling?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; we saw when he looked over at Mrs. Markham.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see Mrs. Markham do anything when he looked at her?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No; she was over there just hollering and screaming.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see her raise her hand to her face in any way?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir. She raised both her hands to her face.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw her do that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see her do anything else?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You say, "He walked around the corner of the house that faces
Patton Street and out of sight." Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "Barbara Davis and I returned to the house where she called the
police." Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. According to the statement then, it says that your sister Barbara
Jeanette called the police after you saw the man, is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "After she called the police, we went back out on the porch but
by then the man we had seen with the gun was no longer in sight."</p>

<p>Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then it says, "When the police arrived we searched the area on
the side of the house that faces Patton Street, and Barbara found a gunshell
that had been fired." It that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That's right.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. "After the police left we again searched the area and I again
found a gunshell that had been fired. I later turned this shell over to the Dallas
Police Department." Is that right?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then it says, "I have been given an opportunity to make additions
and corrections on this statement, and it is true to the best of my knowledge and
belief."</p>

<p>Did they give you an opportunity to make additions and corrections on the
statement?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They did not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did they read the statement back to you?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Not that I remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. They may have but you don't remember.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. May have but I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mrs. Davis, you and I never talked about this matter until
the court reporter started taking your testimony, have we?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I never met you before, is that correct?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Have you ever talked with any person in connection with the
President's Commission before we started taking your testimony here?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to be certain that we get this time sequence correct as to
when you saw the man with the gun and when the police were called, so I am
just going to ask you to sit for about 30 seconds and just think as to just what
did happen, and then just tell the court reporter in your own words just what
did happen there.</p>

<p>(Three minutes of silence.)</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now, Mrs. Davis, you may not be able to remember just what
exactly the time sequence was. You have been sitting here about 3 minutes,
and if you don't remember what the time sequence was, why I would like to
have you so state. But if you do remember&mdash;or do you want more time to think
about it?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, the best I can remember, it was before that we saw the
boy cut across the yard that we called the police, the best that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. In other words, it is your testimony, as I understand it now, that
you heard the shot, and then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We heard the second shot and we ran to the front door.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you see?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw this boy cut across the yard, and we had seen this woman
was coming home from work, she had on a uniform, that was Mrs. Markham&mdash;we
didn't know it was at the time, but she saw all that happen.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What did you do when you got to the door?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We saw the boy cut across our yard.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. At the time you got to the door, did you also see Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see both at approximately the same time?
I will ask you whom did you see first, Mrs. Markham, or the boy cutting across
the yard?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You saw the boy first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That is who we saw first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then you saw Mrs. Markham second?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the boy say anything?</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did Mrs. Markham say anything?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, when she got across the other street, 10th, she hollered, "He's
dead, he's dead, he shot him."</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did she say?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. She was screaming. I don't know.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Then what did you do?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Well, we called the police. Notified them.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. So you called the police after you saw the boy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. After we saw the boy.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. And Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are nodding your head yes. Is that your testimony, to the
best of your recollection?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. That is my testimony.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. I want to ask you again, did you call the police before or after
you saw the boy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. It was after.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir; after, the best that I can remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. The best you can remember, you called the police before or after
you saw the boy?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Before or after?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. After.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. After you saw the boy, you went back in the house and called
the police?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Is there anything else that you can think of that we haven't
talked about that might be helpful in this investigation?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see any ambulance come up to where Officer Tippit was?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; I saw the ambulance.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You got there before the ambulance, did you not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes; we got there before.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did the ambulance get there first or the police get there first?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The ambulance got there first.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see anyone making any calls over Tippit's radio?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got to Tippit's car, did you take a look at that police
car?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. We didn't touch it.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you look at it? Did you notice whether its windows were
rolled up or rolled down?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. The one on his side was rolled down.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. What about the one on the passenger side of the front seat, did
you notice that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Rolled up.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Was that rolled up?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. When you got there?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are nodding your head yes.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Now the front window has kind of a little window in it. Do you
know that little tiny part of the front window that opens and closes?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. Yes, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Do you remember whether that one on the front seat by the right
side of the front seat was open or not?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. It was not open? Or you <span class="locked">don't&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. I don't remember.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you hear anyone make any statements that they had seen
anything other than Mrs. Markham?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Did you see a taxicab parked anywhere in the vicinity?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. You are nodding your head no.</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. Anything else you can think of?</p>

<p>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Davis</span>. No, sir; I think I have told it all.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Belin</span>. All right, Mrs. Davis, we want to thank you very much for taking
the time and the effort to come here. I know that this whole episode has taken
time on your part, and we certainly appreciate your cooperation with the President's
Commission.</p>
